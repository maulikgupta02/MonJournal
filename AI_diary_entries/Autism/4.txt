Nobody, and I say, nobody Is willingly undiagnosed, diagnosis. I'm happy that you could get your own, and I understand that you fought for It, but that doesn't make you better than people who are still fighting or can't fight at all at the moment.

There are so many things that can slow or stop the process of getting a diagnosis, and it's disgusting how those people who happen to have those issues get treated. This Is a bit of a vent but you gotta stop thinking that disabled people can't come from/live in abusive and neglectful households, it's not "unlikely", it's a reality. There are people who cannot get diagnosed till they're 18 (in my country you need to have both parent's written permission to see a therapist) and at that age there's a 95% chance that no doctor will listen to you cause "you're too old to be autistic".

We all should have been diagnosed as kids, but It did not happen, life's unfair, stop making It even more unfair.

"Well you can't be as educated as a therapist/psycologist/blablabla" First of all, bold of you to assume that they're educated on this, cause we all know autism in teens and adults has very little researches on, second, I might not be as educated as them but I'm not stupid, I might not recognize a bounch of diagnosis but I researched about 300+ hours on the topic of autism. I cannot create a program, prescribe medications nor diagnose anyone but me, but I can watch my behaviour from when I was a child to now and see that my behaviour Is not normal for a neurotypical, and I can also whatch my life and say that I'm not able to be indipendent, that I need accomodations.

I know my struggle, you know yours, stop acting like a diagnosis makes you better than me cause It doesn't, we equally need accomodations.

Thanks for reading, I was so angry but now I calmed down. I love you all, you're an amazing community.
