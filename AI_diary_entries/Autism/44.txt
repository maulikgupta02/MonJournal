There's this girl at my school who's very obviously on the spectrum and has much worse social difficulties than I do she shows people videos about King of the Hill or weird videos about Transformers she wears pink cat razor headphones and she always has the wires dangling around near he knees almost touching her untied shoes and often times she will Walk up to complete strangers and makes everyone wildly uncomfortable with whatever she says butting into our conversations and generally being a bother. I can't help but say that I hate her and she's a total annoyance who needs to just sit down and be quiet. But this morning I posted something dumb on my Instagram and thought it was funny and not to be taken seriously I posted something about me having a dream about sex with my friends naming no one specifically and later this evening I get a message from a friend of a friend saying how gross it was then this spirals into a conversation about how I need to work on self-improvement and how there's a bunch of people who I make I make uncomfortable accidentally it made me sick to my stomach because I never knew that what I was doing was gross and off-putting u have a vague idea of that Ive been doing wrong but they didn't tell me specifically it's so hard I don't understand and they aren't really keen on telling me either end I have no way to say I'm sorry because all these people are not autistic and it's hard to explain that some things are not obvious and I'm not a creep I'm just confused I've only had what I would consider real friends for about a year and a half now Im in 10th grade and I've only had people who I really call my friends since the beginning of 9th grade I don't understand people I feel evil I hate myself I don't know if this is because I'm an autist or if I'm just a bad person
