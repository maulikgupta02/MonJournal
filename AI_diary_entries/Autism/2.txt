My therapist: "You meet all the essential autistic criteria but can't be autistic because you've described mimicking other people to fit in and... autistic people don't do that because they aren't interested in social interactions at all." 🤦🏾‍♀️
I can't change therapists at the moment since (a) where I live this therapist is supposed to be one of the better ones, (b) I've suffered through worse and (c) I rely on him for my ADHD meds. At least he responded with an open mind when I told him I'd send him scientific papers to prove him wrong.

I just wanted to share this to vent. The state of qualified mental health 'experts' on this planet! 🙄

(Edit: Thank you for all your words of outrage and support. I'll probably delete this post in a bit though. I'd be mortified if my therapist lurks this sub and identified his words here and recognised me. 😰)

(Edit 2: Whoa, I definitely didn't expect this much engagement for this vent. I don't think I'll ever be able to reply to all the comments, but I do read and appreciate them. Thanks again!)
