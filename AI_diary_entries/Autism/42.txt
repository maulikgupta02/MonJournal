I can't stand it when people interrupt me! I work so hard on my communication skills and that includes not interrupting people while they're talking, but allistics are constantly interrupting me when I'm talking and I can't fuckking stand it! I had to re-interrupt my psychiatrist this morning because he immediately started talking over me while I was explaining something and the stress it caused almost made me go temporarily non-verbal and I could feel my brain starting to shut down. I struggled to get the words out but I was so triggered that I closed my eyes and just said "Doctor Name, please don't interrupt me while I'm talking, I try so hard not to interrupt people while they're talking and I'd appreciate it if people didn't interrupt me either." And just now I was on the phone with a person at another mental healthcare clinic I'm trying to get into and she interrupted me while I was answering a question she asked me. I had to physically set the phone down on my desk and let her finish talking because I know if I interrupted her back and asked her not to interrupt me she might get OFFENDED and make it more difficult for me to be admitted.

Doctors do it all the damn time and it frustrates me knowing I struggle every day just to work a shitty job that doesn't even pay all my bills yet doctors making 6 figures cruise through life without learning BASIC MANNERS!!

STOP!

FUCKING!

INTERRUPTING!

ME!
