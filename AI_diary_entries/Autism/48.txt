Whenever I go to the dentist, doctor, barber shop or whatever else, I get so nervous being in a 1 on 1 situation with an NT I don’t know. I inevitably mess up the small talk, and sometimes I put my foot in it and it makes me feel like I need to apologise. They don’t know I’m ND and I hate upsetting people.

It would be nice if businesses identified if they have someone openly ND or someone autistic-friendly you can communicate with.

According to this research, the moment communication becomes fragmented is between autistic and neurotypical people, but if it’s between two autistic people or two neurotypical people, it’s perfectly coherent!
