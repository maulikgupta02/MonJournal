Idk if this is linked to my very mild autism, but I get super annoyed and angry at ads I watch comfort videos to unwind at night and then a stupid ad comes on with obnoxious voices and music over and over again it is quite like a fnaf jumpscare just completely out of nowhere and mildly annoying like sensory overload and a sudden change of mood and sound is overwhelming to me that I want to yell. It doesn't even hit my 19-year-old demographic no I don't know anything about website business graphs building or whatever nor do I want to. No I am not falling for those fake discount ads I wasn't born yesterday. If ads are in the beginning or end of the video then I could tolerate it but if it keeps interrupting my videos i'm not listening to it nor buying it. The most annoying thing ever is these fake mobile game ads usually it's thirst traps of some half-naked woman in a sexual position for clickbait or some basic puzzle game where whoever playing has one brain cell that died of loneliness and can't solve it god I miss the old angry birds ads I would settle for those any day.
