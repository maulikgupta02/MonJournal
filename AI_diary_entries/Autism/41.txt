(14) I’ve had terrible eye-hand coordination ever since I was young. I had to get early intervention, or whatever that is, since I was 3. I had trouble doing common things that other kids could do, or I did them way differently than what was expected.

Focusing on now, I am a digital artist. I’ve been one for almost 8 years, and it’s one of my special interests. My eye hand coordination is really good with drawing but not much else. At school, we’ve been having a volleyball unit and I’m terrible at it. Especially serving, any time I try to serve, I miss it completely. Literally everyone BUT me has gotten it, along with passing. Any time I try to pass, I fling the ball in a entirely new direction or behind me, so I don’t really do anything during class which makes me feel bad for my team. Along with that, I’ve had trouble with video games that are fast platformers or rhythm games, i really wish I had a video to show you all on how I miss basically every single note unless it’s on easy and super slow mode. I have to stare and process the notes before I put them down, and half of the time that doesn’t even work.
