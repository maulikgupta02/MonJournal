i had proper burnout at work the other day, just so many sounds and things going on around me and i went outside to collect myself. i came back in and had managed to calm down just for my colleague to say how she is “definitely autistic” and i asked why and she couldn’t really name any symptom that she correlates with. (no one really at work knows i’m autistic and i tend to not mention it) it really upset me and i’m not sure why. like i know self diagnosis is bad but i don’t think i’d be able to explain why? i went home and ranted to my boyfriend because it was like i went through all that struggling and masking my whole life just for this one person to say she’s definitely autistic. i have friends too that now they’ve met me (a lvl 1) they think all autistic people are like me so are constantly saying to eachother, “oh he’s got autism i’m sure of it”. i just sit there and don’t know what to do in those situations.

id really appreciate if someone could maybe explain why self diagnosis is bad? i know it is but unsure what i would say in a situation when someone asks me why.

how do i stop myself from getting so wound up over stuff like this?
