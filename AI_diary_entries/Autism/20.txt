I used to listen to Harry Potter every night to fall asleep. I started doing this when I was 7 or 8 years old, and I've done it religiously since then (I'm now 25). Well, for a long time now I've been trying to stop this because I HATE Rowling and her bigotry. But it's been hard. Like, so hard. It's been part of my routine for so long. I've tried other books that I really like, but they're not as... I guess childish, so I end up focusing on them way too much. I've tried brown noise, but there's not enough to focus on so my mind starts racing. It's gotten to the point that I've felt meltdowns coming on before bed and it feels so pathetic. I'm a 25 year old who is on the verge of a breakdown because I can't have my silly little bedtime story... UGH.
