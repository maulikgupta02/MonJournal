I spend all my free time watching tiktok or YouTube because it gives me adrenaline. I don't do anything I don't know what to do. I have free time because I'm still a minor and don't have to work or pay taxes, but what's the point in having free time if you don't know what to do with it? I sit for hours scrolling on my phone because I don't know what to do. It's become a massive problem and I don't know what to do about it

Basically my Dad admitted that he only "plays" along with my diagnosis to pacify me. Basically he believes I am "to intelligent" to hace high functioning autism and don't understand why masking 24/7 is debilitating to my mental health.
