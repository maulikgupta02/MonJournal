I know this isn't an airport, but I'm announcing my departure
I'm out. I loved this community and it has helped me immeasurably, but I can't cope with my reddit home page being forks and spoons all day every day. Not only that, but the TBH creature and the awful debates all the time...

This community is a shell of its former self and I'm giving up hope that it'll ever be any good again.

If anyone can recommend a replacement subreddit - free from fork/spoon spam - where autistic people can go for advice, support or just to vent and share cool things, please let me know in the comments.

Enjoy your forks and spoons I guess. No hate from my side, I'm just saying I can't take it anymore which is why I'm withdrawing. Me disliking fork/spoon posts and TBH posts doesn't mean they're bad, but it does mean staying in this sub isn't healthy for my reddit experience. That's all.
