This might not be an autistic thing but I tend to form imaginary friendships in my mind rather than go out and make friends. It's kinda strange for me to fantasize about having friends but I fall into the thoughts over and over again. But when I actually do have friends it's an unpleasantish experience and I end up wishing that I didn't have friends. It's a strange dichotomy, but I'm hoping that anyone else can relate to this and maybe add some wisdom to the situation.
