When I was 14 years old, I would enter an “approved private school” that was meant for people ages 5 - 21 on the spectrum. Sounds functional, until you see the dark reality it has.

When I went to this school, I had nothing but fear, anxiety, depression, trauma, and PTSD from all the stuff I had to endure. I was bullied by both students and staff.

One day, On December 17th, 2021, I was in my English class drawing rude pictures of staff, like any other high school student would do. Next thing you know, the teacher threatened me, saying “keep doing that shit, I’ll knock you to the fucking ground”. Next thing you know, I flipped out at them, and ended up being pinned down after getting destructive. The teacher aid was yelling in my face, threatening to get my job taken, pay for his broken laptop, etc.

After the whole incident, I was left bruised up, with my forehead enflamed, and a black eye. The teacher and aid would end up being fired, and I would last another 2 months, before I would end up leaving after getting into a fight with another student over me getting the teachers fired.

The day I left that school, I was mentally broken. I felt as if I had nowhere else to go. I was lucky enough to be accepted into a different school that actually teaches me something and doesn’t treat everyone very strictly. If I wasn’t accepted, I more than likely would’ve dropped out…

Few months went by, and nearly a year later, I was informed that I would be getting compensation for what happened that day. Im now 18 years old, going off to college in August 2023, and with the money I had received, gotten myself a new car. Idc what people think and if I was in the wrong, it shouldn’t have happened in the first place, and I regret my decisions to this day.
