My mom has been constantly reminding me over the past 2 years that we were going to move but now the process is actually starting and I'm getting scared. The moves we did in the past were okay because I didn't have as much of a life there as I do here. I just want things to stop and for me to just be able to stay here. I can see the logic in us moving, even if she says my "Exectutive Dysfunction" is causing me to not be able to see it, but I'm happy here. I have a life, friends who love and support me, a college I want to go too, but my mom isn't happy here she can't move on so we have to move because it's cheaper and she can get a job (BS her stupid conspiracies are what's stopping her from getting a job). I don't like change, and her telling me we were going to move in the past gave me anxiety and she said she would stop talking about it but she didn't and now were here where she's getting things started and I won't see my friends again and I won't be able to make as many friends as close as the ones I have here because it took me ages to get the ones I have because talking to people is hard.
