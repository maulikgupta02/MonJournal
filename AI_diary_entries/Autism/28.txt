I've always been a picky eater. And i think it's probably because of this that I became a cook in the first place (i identify myself in the job, so thats a great thing). When i was learning how to make things of course i did in a slightly different way that I like better, Lately i realized that not even the food my parents and grandparents make im enjoying anymore. I can eat obviously when there's a gathering, festivities, or buying food that i like. But in day to day life I can't think "this meal is nice" nowadays I only like things the way i make them
