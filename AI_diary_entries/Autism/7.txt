Dear non disabled parents of disabled children and “allies” of the community
STOP SPEAKING FOR US. Stop overstepping your boundaries and talking over us! Stop selling merchandise about our disabilities! Stop profiting off of your children! Stop supporting awful organizations and not allowing us to educate you. Stop acting as if you know more about our disabilities than we do! Just stop. These “autism moms” on social media enrage me. Acting as if their child being disabled and them taking care of a child they chose to have makes them a hero. Fuck all the way off. I just saw a mom say we all prefer differently abled to special needs. Fuccccck right off! Please scream and vent all you want in the comments because I am in the mood to read everyone’s vents right now. edit: looks like i offended the very parents i was speaking about. crazy how they show themselves every time. parents getting offended that an autistic person has trouble making themselves clear? shocking
