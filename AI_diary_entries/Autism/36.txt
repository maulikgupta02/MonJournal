I just had my birthday yesterday, which was great! I was so happy pretty much all day, my parents got me an awesome new TV that's wayy better than my old one, and my best friend even surprised us by showing up and gave me a really cute plush (I think is what it's called) and a little cat bean bag thing that looks like an egg!

Not one sad moment that day, but the week before that was really slow cause I had to work especially hard in school to bring my grades back up (and the teachers were saying this is the best week I've had idk why this is the most depressing week I've had in a while)

But all of that combined with even more anxiety about a bowling party in the future because my brain always wants to be anxious about something, it's just... a lot

And today it just got really overwhelming and even though they were happy all the strong emotions happy and sad just clashed and I just feel sad, angry, and anxious

It feels wired to be sad after a birthday, honestly feel a little selfish too, I don't even know if this is an autism thing, just wanted to put it in a place where I feel most safe in where people I can relate to can see it

Well, sorry for the rant, just wanted to get a bit off my chest cause damn, it's been quite the week
