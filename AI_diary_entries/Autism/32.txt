So uuuh cw for animal death and talk of death in general.

So it's kinda a sad day in my house my mom's dog sadly passed away this morning he was a 16 year old Boston terrier my family is obviously very upset sense he's been with us for a very long time however I noticed something odd about myself during this. Whenever death happens in the family an animal or a person I don't go though the griefing process or it feels like I don't I kinda just go straight to acceptance. Obviously it's sad you know seeing anyone go but I'm not sobbing over it...UNLESS I see the body the moment I see the body I do get very very uncomfortable this happens even before death but when there about to die I can't look at them because my mind just gets too overwhelmed but when It does happen I just accept it no tears no anger just "man...this sucks...but he was old...and at least he's with his human dad and dog dad now..." It makes me feel guilty tho because I wanna comfort my family but I don't grieve like they do and it sucks
