You know the face. It’s such a simple face, where a smile or neutral expression changes ever so slightly.

It’s the face that says “you’re weird.”

The face that reminds me why I have three friends.

The face that makes me remember that for some reason being autistic means that everyone hates me.

But it’s not because I’m autistic, because “I’ve never seen any of the symptoms” says Kira, my best friend. She thinks she knows everything because she was in AP psych.

Kira was an awful friend.

She’s not the first person to tell me that I don’t have the symptoms of an autistic person.

They’re right in some ways.

I can make eye contact. I don’t stim… or wait, maybe I do? I can tell when others are upset, although sometimes I can’t. I’m too smart to be “low functioning” but I’m not smart enough to be one of those “high functioning” geniuses. I can read facial expressions. I understand social rules. In fact, I understand social rules better than anyone. I love rules. So much. Rules make me feel comfortable. When there’s no rules, no guidance, I feel lost. Although sometimes guidance makes me feel more lost.

Plus, everyone’s a little autistic.

I can tell when people are upset. But the problem is I can’t comfort them. I’m not a monster, I have empathy, I think I have more empathy than most neurotypical people. I just don’t know what to do with it. I don’t know how to apply it.

And I can read facial expressions. Just like how every time I’m a little too loud, or I’m a little too invested in a topic, or I’m a little too childish, people make that face. The same face. The one that reminds me that I was born to be lonely and isolated.
