18(m) autistic and asexual. ( What a fun combination definitely doesn't make things harder )

I have learnt something. I like friendships with 2 people, me and someone else. As soon as a third person enters the group I feel... left out. No matter how much I mean to the OG friend I'm always going to be last. I gain a superpower, invisibility. I became a ghost. I lose my ability to be heard. After a while the other 2 people will just leave.

This has happened countless times, it's almost a guarantee that it will happen lol. It's happening as I'm writing this.

Why can't someone be ok with just me? Is there a person out there that'll think I'm enough?

Ik it's " normal " to have a big social life. I just can't handle a big social life.
