I'm so anxious and have been thinking about this for days. not sure how to word this but "wrong mask" seems to fit best with what I mean.

I've been with family members I haven't seen in years over the past few days and have been struggling to fit in and seem normal. I don't really want to share my autism diagnosis with them and dont feel safe unmasking with them.

I'm just really embarrassed as I said loads of things wrong and acted the way I masked in school back 5 years or so ago when I was trying to fit in with the popular kids (I'm now in my 20s and don't mask so much with friends) but it was the complete wrong "mask" for this specific set of family members.

I called all my interests and stuff cringe and was like "im glad I'm not like that anymore" (which was a lie) and then remembered that this set of family members actually like those interests so I didn't need to mask that and now they think I hate the things I love and I'm worried I've offended them

I just want to hide from everyone and feel so embarrassed and ashamed of everything I do. I'm so exhausted trying to fit in 24/7 only to end up not being true to myself and accidentally masking wrong

I feel like coming back home for a bit from uni has made me slip into my old masking rather than my current masking

basically I used my "seem normal to the popular teens mask" instead of my "seem normal to my nice yet distant cousins and aunts mask" and said so much that I regret.
