I feel like I am always cringing at myself for every little interaction. Today I had to call my manager to explain something to her, but someone else picked up instead and i didn't realize it. I ended up saying what i wanted to say to the wrong person, and they said "ok let me pass you with the manager". I felt so embarassed. Things like these happen several times a day to me. I have to think logically and tell myself that interactions like that don't matter and that it happens to everyone. But it makes me feel stupid all the time. I don't know where I' going with this but i just wanted to vent.

"stop giving me excuses" is a statement i never understood growing up. i'd give them reasons as to why i made decisions and that's the response i got every time. i don't know what you want me to tell you, lady!
