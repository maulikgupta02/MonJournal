I mean he always had it and i know it scared me for good.He picked me up extremely late from school or kindergarten, yelled at me a ton, never kept a routine, etc..Especially the yelling gave me pretty bad meltdowns and the lack of routine (that I badly need cause my adhd wont let me keep one up) really give me hard times Now he got a second child (my parents are divorced) and I feel even less cared about.I dont have my own room at my dads too His new girlfriend lives with us too and her son also visits over the weekends ( he is 8 and also autistic) Fyi i am diagnosed adhd but undiagnosed autism so self diagnosed I feel so much left behind and unloved from him even tho I know its just because of his adhd.His girlfriend cared abt me a lot and comforts me more than he does when i have a tough tile or just rant about my special interest I am not sure if and how i could forgive him (iâ€˜m 15 btw) Thanks for reading, maybe u habe some tips how to handle the situation
