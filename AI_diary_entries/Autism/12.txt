I just saw another post of someone sharing a video of their non-verbal son being on holiday with them. The title was pointing out his disabilities and said something around the line of 'He reminds us to be happy even though he can't speak' and I found it awful. To me it was as if the parents were patting themselves on the back a la: 'Oh look we are such great people for raising our disabled son now give us upvotes'.

And it made me wonder if he even consented to being filmed and have his video shared to hundreds of thousands strangers on the internet. It did not appear as if they ask him beforehand.

The comments were also pretty bad. To cut them some slack though, I'm sure they were well-intended. But reading stuff about 'How inspirational' this is (Even though it was literally just a family on holiday? Not sure how this can be inspirational...) was just so bad. Or other stuff like 'Being with disabled people makes me enjoy life so much. Just seeing how happy they are.' The comment is clearly not mean, but it just rubs me the wrong way.

How is it so hard for non-disabled/neurotypical people to think of us as normal people and not some sort of inspirational p#rn to make themselves feel better?
