Ok so now I realise this was fully related to my autism and trying to fit in/mask but not knowing social appropriateness etc. I was very young in primary school and there was the class clown as always and he said something very mildly rude during a whole class activity. So when I was next up I said a similar story and the teacher raged at me in front of everyone, cancelled the whole activity because it was inappropriate and labelled it as my fault to everyone that it was my fault and said to everyone that I’m the reason we are having to quit the activity early and go do proper work. I’ve literally not gotten over this and it was because I didn’t pick up her passive aggression towards the student who made the rude comment (honestly it was sooo mild and stupid, no swearing or sex related or anything like that). I still feel so freaking humiliated by this to the point I was throwing up in the toilet when the activity was cancelled and I remember being so terrified to go back to school and literally wanting to die. I feel so bad for childhood me and even if I wasn’t autistic it was still so inappropriate for her to do that.
