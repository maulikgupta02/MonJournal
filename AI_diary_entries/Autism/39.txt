I’ve been really lonely the past couple years and lately I’ve been trying to make friends, only online since I don’t really have a way to do it irl but still. I feel like I’m always having to carry conversations or to entice the other person to talk to me. Which I don’t know if that means that they just don’t want to talk to me and if I should just stop or something

I was talking to someone earlier and they mentioned that they wanted to call and we mostly just asked what the other person likes or what shows they are into and 7 minutes in they left and messaged that it was too awkward which just felt like a shot in the stomach, I have mentioned my ASD and my struggles with talking over voice but did it anyway. After that I kind of just feel like giving up again since I feel like whatever I do isn’t going to work
