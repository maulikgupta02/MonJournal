I just need to vent I am so upset. I went to the doctor today. I have a really hard time with doctors appointments between anxiety and communication issues (anxiety often makes it really hard for me to talk or effectively communicate). Because of this I usually write down what I would like to say/questions that I have. So I said that, “I have a really hard time talking so I wrote it down.” And the doc replied, “I’m not reading all that.” and I literally couldn’t even voice the main concern I had. I was so upset and embarrassed, and in result got nothing out of the appointment - but shame, and even more anxiety. 😞 All forms of communication should be accepted!!

This condition is one of the worst things to ever happen to me, possibly the worst. I'm only mildly autistic, which means I have the limitations put on me, and the realisations of what those are, which is ultimately depressing on an almost existential level. I'll never be able to make friends like others, even with other autists. I'll never find true happiness, or even enjoyment, in anything I do, because my hyperfixations make me unable to think of anything but The Thing, and if I can't prove to be effective at The Thing then I'm just wallowing in a depression of my own failure. I'll never succeed at anything, or grow beyond my stunted mind, or achieve anything in life that would even be considered mundane by most. This vile, horrendous condition has ruined my every being and potential for anything. I hate autism so damn much.
