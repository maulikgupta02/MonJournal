Currently sitting on my kitchen floor, blazing and eating a meal I cooked with patience and care. Life is alright and my pets are healthy, as for myself. I love myself and I enjoy sharing positivity with the world, but I have no friends. Zero. Not even one person that I can call on the phone or talk to. I don’t understand why if everyone is always saying the most heart warming things… am I boring? Am I annoying? How come the most hateful people have best friends and relationships and I’m here venting to an audience I might not even get to… sigh.
