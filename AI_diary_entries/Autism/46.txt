what it says on the tin. the friend got super upset at me about it last year and i didnâ€™t make a reminder in my phone, apparently. we both have diagnosed adhd but i am the only one with suspected autism.

we havenâ€™t been interacting as much as we did when we were younger and itâ€™s just so fucking hard to remember shit when itâ€™s not right in front of my face. she doesnâ€™t usually reach out to me first about anything. we havenâ€™t talked in a month and so i texted her today. she didnâ€™t respond and i didnâ€™t question it, but then several hours later i realized i missed her birthday by two weeks. again. i apologized and she hasnâ€™t said anything.

last year i had a two week long mental breakdown over this because i felt like such shit about it and therapy has made me deal with this so much better this year so iâ€™m not completely beating myself to a pulp about it but i still feel like such a fucking asshole. iâ€™m going to make her a gift basket and leave it outside of her apartment.

so anyway i have an alarm in my phone for it now ðŸ«  if she still wants to be friends this time next year i sure will remember then! aha ha ha â€¦. haâ€¦..
