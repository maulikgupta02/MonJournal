The constant fear of being misunderstood kills me, every time I talk to someone I’m over sharing and I don't think about what I'm saying and it gives me a lot of anxiety afterwards, because I'm not good at using the right words to express myself and I ALWAYS share things that’s not considered normal to talk about because I can't make small talk no matter how hard I try. I’m terrified of being judged by the world because the world have misunderstood me because of my ability to express myself.

I’m about to cry my neighbours have kids over and they’re playing outside and they keep loudly screaming. I can’t do anything about it I don’t want to talk to my neighbours they don’t seem like nice people from what I know of them and it’s not like I would call the cops on a bunch of seven year olds. I just don’t know what to do it’s april and I know this will keep happening throughout the whole summer for all the best days to be outside so I’ll never be able to be outside my house in the nice days I hate my neighbours so much.
