I got diagnosed last year when I (f17) finally got my parents to agree to test me. The woman doing it said that I 'just made the cut' by like a single point. This has led my parents to say that I'm not actually autistic.

When I get overstimulated or extremely stressed, I'm forced to continue doing or being involved with whatever is upsetting me.

Every time I have a breakdown or meltdown or just a panic attack, my dad says I'm being manipulative and playing the victim. He mocks me and says that I'm crazy.

Neither of my parents want to acknowledge that I have autism and they force me into overstimulating situations and then act like I'm victimizing myself when I freak out.

I truly do not know anymore and I'm starting to think maybe I am just manipulating everyone for my own personal gain and that I'm not actually autistic.

I want a therapist but the only options around me were ABA and normal therapists (non autism). And the normal ones won't call my parents back.

My parents do a lot more and I'll continue in the comments if anyone asks.
