One of the most frustrating things about having autism is knowing you often get upset about things that seem very minuscule or childish to get upset about. You know it's no big deal, but you're still upset. And you know you can't tell people how they've upset you because you know how absurd and ridiculous it sounds to a normal person. It makes it very difficult to have lasting human connections.
