I just went to Walmart and these 2 guys maybe around 19/20 were laughing hysterically at their autism awareness shirts and making fun of people with autism and it just made my blood boil! They were like “if I buy that shirt, you have to wear it” ugh I wanted to give them a piece of my mind but… my shy autistic butt couldn’t do it 😂😡 I just wanna know what’s so damn funny about autism. So of course I can’t let it go and needed to vent
