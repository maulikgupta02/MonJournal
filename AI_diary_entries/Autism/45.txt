First to the stupid copers who say "oh attraction isnt physical" and "oh you are just being negative" stfu coz u have no idea what it is like to be us. I know i am unattractive coz women always appear repulsed and make excuzes to move away from me. Their tones change. They stop smiling. I can hear them gossip about me behind my back.

Being attractive as an Aspie shouldnt be a problem for u. Yes people who show interest u initially slowly slip away and stop talking to u oncd they get to know the real you. Yes you get unwanted attention. BUT AT LEAST U GET PRACTICE. You automatically are given the chance to be able to practice social skills and develop them over time because u get basically unlimited chances to talk romantically to women who approach u etc. U can formulate the best strategies and learn social skills natutrally if u keep trying.

On the other hand if u are balding short ugly fat etc. U might as well be asexual. Lol women just act asexual around u. U NEVER GET PRACTICE. Never get the chance to experiment with social acts and behaviours. Never get to even touch someone lol

This is why it is so important to be neurotypical. Even if u are the ugliest shortest fat person in the world u can get the hottest victoria secret supermodel just coz ur neurotypical. I always see the most unattraictive men with the most beautiful women.

Conclusion. It is extremely important to have one of either being good looking or being neurotypical. If u have both u probably did something good in ur past life and god rewarded u. If u dont have either of them.....my god help u. I dont know what to do. Im balding at 19, uglt fat and short. AND aspie......
