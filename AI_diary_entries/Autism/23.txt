I was in a concert today (I have no problem with audio and visual stimulations so I am able to go to concerts), and I had a somehow meltdown because of something that the vocalist said between music's. It was a big trigger for me and I wanted to cry out loud but I couldn't. I just closed my eyes and "cried inside". Now I am alone in my home feeling like trash.
