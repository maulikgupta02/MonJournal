Squipy back at it again with the social stuff I don't understand! I've noticed in society that when you turn 21 heck not even that but high school it's seen as some social big event where you have to try alcohol and I just don't get it! Without going into too much detail alcohol has caused nothing but problems in my life! I don't care if people drink as long as there responsibile about it and not driving and ya know just being a nuisance! The issue I have is how when I turn 21 or heck even before that I was supposed to drink alcohol?? I remember my friend and I were talking and she said how she went Paris over the summer and went to try a bunch of different wines and stuff which is when she told me she was going to take me to a bar when I'm 21 to try alcohol for the first time to which I quickly declined to when she turned around offended and was like "you can't live in your sheel forever" like??? why is it something that has caused so many problem's not just in my life but others lives seen as this requirement to be seen as a normal adult?? Like I've seen people when they hear someone who's 21+ not drink alcohol there seen as like :O how could you!!!
