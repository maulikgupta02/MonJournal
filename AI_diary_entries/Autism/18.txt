I’ve always been very sensitive to sound, especially when i got older. I’m very picky about what i listen to; everything needs to be at the perfect volume, audiobook voice actors are researched, I’ve listened to a same podcast every day for 4 years because i haven’t found another one that i like, it doesn’t bother me. I carry earplugs at all times, wear giant safety headphones on firework holidays, and i swear to god sometimes i hear something in the distance and my ear twitches involuntarily. i’ve come accept my hearing sensitives.

that being said, i hate that i don’t really like music. I love art, in all of its wacky forms; and i love the emotional and often visual aspects of music. I love poetry and i love studying lyrics, i think i spend more time studying lyrics than listening to music. I have favorite bands, but when i listen to them i have to be comfortable and be able to turn it off whenever i want. and it makes me upset that i can’t experience music the way most of my friends do. id much rather sit in silence, but that’s not my fault.
