Everytime I try to vent to my parents or to neurotypical people, they tell me either of these things :

- "it's normal to act like someone you're not when you're outside" (yes but it's not the same as MASKING EVERYTHING YOU ARE)

- "relationships are hard, I also have troubles with them" (we have vastly different troubles)

- "it's not the others who exclude you, it's you who exclude yourself" (I truly wish it was the case)

- "I had the same problems, but I overcame them by yoga/working on myself/plants/going out" (we neither had the same problems to begin with)

Why is it so complicated for them to understand that we are different ? That we have vastly different experiences of life ? Why do they think their life experiences are universal ?

I just wish someone could tell me "I get you, I see you're struggling, and yes it's hard", instead of trying to tell me these things.
