Ever since i can remember, i've always been a " loud " bpd, i've stood up for myself even though everybody thought i was wrong, i gave over the top reactions to thinking i've been wronged, i've ranted and raved my head off at getting hurt by people and i've held grudges for years.

Not tonight, i feel like i'm coming to a breaking point, in the middle of venting they fell asleep on me and i felt the weight of all my previous sitations collapsing down on me and i just mentally went

" No. Not again. This is the last time i'm showing any hurt or any negative emotion anymore. This is all just bullshit, if i don't want to be hurt then i'll just show i'm not hurt. By anything. "

Can people just choose to be a quiet bpd? I feel like that's what i'm choosing, to just suffer silently by myself because i'm sick and tired of putting up a losing fight every damn time.
