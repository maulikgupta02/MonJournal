I just feel like such a burden and that im not taken seriously. I know where it all comes from and why, but im still in the environment i grew up with which doesnt help with healing.

My husband, we live with my family atm, is leagues better. But sometimes I'll just get triggered and feel the exact same way my family makes me feel.

And the fact i cant always articulate what im feeling, which causes him to " give me space " sucks.

I want to act out. I want to break things and throw things and scream and cut all my hair off but i cant. Because i know ill regret it and start a cycle.

But it physically hurts to keep it all in and feel like a child around everyone.
