Toward the end of last year, I spent two weeks in a psychiatric hospital in Melbourne. This is the third time I’ve been in such a hospital, but my first time in Melbourne, a city I only just moved to earlier in the year. The reason for this most recent admission was my difficulty living and working with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and specifically an invalidating workplace which culminated in me self-harming for the first time in over two years. The reason I want to share my diaries is to record from first person what the hospital is really like; the heightened states, the intensity, as well as the boredom and the great struggles, but also the great joys that can be experienced there. I have read a number of articles about what it is like to be in hospital and also on the horror of being discharged back into the world, but I think a more personal account could shine a more vivid light. Many readers will know exactly what I’m describing, but for friends and families of people battling mental illness, I hope this can bring some great insight and compassion.

Just as an update for 2020, it hasn’t been an easy time since I left hospital, especially in finding more suitable work, but I will keep fighting with the same resilience as I was when I was in the hospital toward a life worth living.

A final note on how I’ve used names. I was powerfully impacted by meeting a number of people while in hospital. For obvious reasons, I have avoided using any of their names. However, there are two people who feature throughout and I’ve given them randomly selected initials so the reader can identify them. I’ve stolen this initials trick from my favorite writer Helen Garner’s own journals published last year.
