I slept for so long it shook memories lose. I have never thought of myself as a good person. Ten years ago after my breakdown, I encountered a darkness inside me after a very straining relationship. I stole her dog just to get revenge on her. I gave it back but I remember the aftermath; believing I was a villain, believing I was an evil person.
