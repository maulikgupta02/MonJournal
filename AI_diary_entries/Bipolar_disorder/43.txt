My inability to make " real friends " My intense hate bursts My inability to connect with anyone on a deep level. My dramatic need for attention, even negative. My binging fits , weight fluctuation . got fit to obese and back 3 times in a span of 10 years. Having sex with no condom in public places. Unable to have a stable and balanced relationship. My attraction to women who can only fuck up my life. My Sociopathic behaviour fits where everyone is my enemy and has it coming. Me punching my forehead when extremely frustrated. My extreme emotional sensitivity to rejection. My tendency to shut everyone off and withdraw into my head. My procraatination.

And now I am 31 with no close friends to speak of, living with my parents, doing a design job with shit pay. Watching people enjoy meaningful relationships while in my mind everyone is suspect to betray me in the future or my friends are jealous of me. Why would they even be jealous of me.

I took 10 mg of lexapro per day to fight the mood swings and the first 5 months were great. I gained around 40 pounds of weight which made my self image frustration even worse. My psychiatrist didnt help me much with any psychotherapy. I weened off lexapro, instead taking 5 mg every couple of days to find the energy and libido to hit the gym again and become fit.

SSRIS are a very temporary solution.

But interpersonal relationships are my biggest weakness. I just want my crowd. A couple of people that I can do stuff with. That are gonna invite me out to stuff. I took the initiative to do stuff with my " friends " but I always get rejected and they do stuff without me.

You know what , fuck them.
