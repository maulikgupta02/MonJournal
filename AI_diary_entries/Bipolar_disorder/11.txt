Out of hospital. Feel so desolate. Confused. Stateless. Anchorless. As if my very being, my very soul, my very mind had been cut adrift. Hard to concentrate. Hard to make any sense of the outside world. The pain of separation from the hospital cocoon. My people. I want to be back in their embrace. At least this time I won’t have to work tomorrow. But instead tonight I will see my friend commissioned as a minister in a new congregation. I know it will be painful to be among so many people who have no idea what I’ve just been through, nor see the lostness in my eyes. Maybe they will. How can I make this about my friend? It is probably time I prayed for some help outside my own failing being. My chest has gone out in sympathy with acid reflux.
