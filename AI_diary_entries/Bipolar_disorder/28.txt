For a long time I tried to vent with those I wanted to be friend. Well in the beggining they show interest to suppot me but if I speaak about Suicide/family problems/lack of friends they suddenly they are gone or I don't feel really supported. So I developed this pretending behavior: everytime I feel bad I runaway in order to not showing I am feeling bad. A time passed so I told someone that I have begun to trust " You know at work when I stay lonely and say I am ok ? In truth I am very very bad feeling lonely"

And them they answered: "I know. "

This made me feel more loenely. I know they aren't guilty of not understanding my way to think or my needs but it is not they who suffer.
