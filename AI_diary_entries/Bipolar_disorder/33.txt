Just went through a "best friend " break up. They essentially throw every aspect of my mental illness(es) back in my face. I've worked my god damn ass off to get where I am and one message sent me spiraling deep enough I'm having an identity issue again. Not quite a crisis but definitely struggling with my reality being real and if I'm a real person. It's coming and going and I think little things are triggering it. I think I'm frustrated because this person is NOT innocent either and has also caused me trauma.

I absolutely acknowledge that people are not required to stay in my life due to the BPD (or any reason). It is HARD. And i know I've caused harm. I have apologized and made big strides to redeem myself. I've put in the work and I've changed the actions and responses the best I can. I still acknowledge that people may still decide to leave and if they feel like they need to, okay then do so. I wont stop you. But DO NOT shame me and throw my mental illness back in my face. Just leave and say you no longer wish to be apart of my life. I know the BPD is alot. I know I can be irrational. I have healed alot of my fears of abandonment. I don't want or need people who will continually harm me or resent me constantly in my life.

I i also genuinely think at the point I'm at after completing DBT and my continued therapy that I dont even know how to stand up for myself to certain people due feeling like I'll be invalidated anyways. To this "best friend", I was always wrong and always at fault but come to find out from someone else close to us that that easnt the case and they were just pushing fault on me to take the easy way out. I guess it's always easier to blame the person with BPd.

I am mostly venting but am open to getting advice as well.
