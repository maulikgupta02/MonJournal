My anger is being controlled by medications. When I’m not medicated, I feel the rage, the pain, the anger. I’m gifted with a great heart and cursed with an intellectual brain with learning disabilities. I’m a regular catch 22. I watched one of my recent documentaries and it broke my heart that I made never get to make another one. It hurts me to admit I’m beat. I changed for the worst when I did journalism and even worst than that, it cripples my causes when I’m forced to face the truth; I’m a journalist with a mental illness. My body has betrayed me and my credibility. I can’t stop people from gaslighting me, but it’s so painful. I can’t be who I want to be. I guess I completely sabotaged myself and here I am. A mess for the world to mock and discredit via credibility.

I finally admit it. I won’t be returning to journalism. My heart can’t help from more tragedy and I can’t bare to watch another primary get rigged. I want out of this shit storm so bad.

I have to figure out how to figure out what went wrong. Today, I have Missy a place to sleep so she’s out of the sun. I will be in terrible trouble if Lorrie finds out but I can’t let anyone be homeless. I’ll help her for today only.

I am a mess right now. The Adderall takes away the mental block and gives me an attention span. The Minipress takes away my nightmares. The Seroquel allows me to sleep and prevents homicidal ideation from becoming a manifestation of reality. The cannabis helps depression, anxiety and it helps control my thoughts. I’m addicted to cannabis and becoming addicted to Seroquel and how it makes me feel. I’m becoming more “Brandon” and less of the dark passenger I was becoming. A rebirth can’t hurt. I can do better, be better and have better. I can’t be the person that gives up. I have to see this through. I can and will become mentally stable again. I don’t have to be broken and damaged. I can be renewed, rejuvenated and reborn.
