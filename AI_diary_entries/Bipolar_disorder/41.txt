I just went to the supermarket. Have bpd and more, am ND and am social anxious so its not easy. With my backpack on. And a shopping bag with a plastic bottle to recycle in it.

I walked around in the supermatket, I had picked up a shopping basket too. And collected my stuff.

I went to self checkout counters. My shopping bag with bottle....where?????? Gone. Just gone. I walked all my steps back in the store. Gone. I vaguely remember puttong it between my legs, standing in front of either the breadcounter or dairy, to free my hands and collect an item. Thats it. Gone.

I put away my handgloves at home, " oh this is a good place for them". Famous last words. Gone. Poof.

This year alone: My old wallet, 2 pair of climbingshoes, 2 cords to load up my mobile phone, 1 bankcard, 1 gymmembershipcard, 3 books, 1 sweater: all " in the perfect spot for this item". ????? Paralel universe???? Dementia???? Im so upset right now.

Like, I can be doing 1 thing, washing the dishes with running water, my kids ask something, I leave for thimg nmbr 2, boom, water runs over the sink into a socket near my oven, down our electricity. And so on and so on.... ðŸ˜žðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž I hate myself.
