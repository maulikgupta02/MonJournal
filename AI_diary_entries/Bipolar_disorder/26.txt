Hi Male 22 Latino (not native speaker)
I am a student at health sector and me and my classmates tke care of patient in clinics/hospitals. Mental health it is not our area, but it is obvious that we have to work considering mental healthy problems of our patients. It is often how I hear they saying things like: "oh that person is crazy", "That patient is nuts, it was hard to get rid of him", " I wish I had not to help a person like her", "Thank god my patient it is not like yours, he is like crying baby"

Sometimes I judge them, but everytime I asl myself " What they think of me? What would thet think if they know I have bpd? Is it possible that don't see me as equal because how they see mental health problems?
