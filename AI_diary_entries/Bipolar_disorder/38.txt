We've been together 10 years. He's helped me get out of the toxic " crab in a bucket " mentality my family has. I'll be the first in my family going to college and living on my own. Im grateful to him and hes amazing at supporting me.

However, theres always this nagging feeling hes going to eventually leave me. That he'll grow bored of me or is just staying because he feels bad for me and when I'm more stable he'll leave because he won't feel obligated to stay anymore. It doesn't help that I'm AMAZING at reading too much into things that aren't there.

Lack of intimacy ? Definitely not the depression and opposite work schedules. Super just the fact that he doesn't actually love me or find me attractive at all.

The fact he says I'm a distraction to his writing ? Not just because I can get talkative. It's definitely cause he enjoys writing more than my company and finds the fact I'm around annoying and a burden.

I hate this. I hate feeling dependant on people and being terrified they're hiding how they really feel about me and going to leave me. Or that they only stay around me because they pity me.

I'd rather just be on my own with maybe a pet or something than with people. Its exhausting. Being me is so exhausting.
