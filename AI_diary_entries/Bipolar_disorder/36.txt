I was diagnosed after an attempt 5 years ago. Long story short I spent time in inpatient as well as IOP and done a tremendous amount of work on my self to "recover". I still experience emptiness, anxiety and sometimes I have outbursts but I haven't SH since my attempt. Last month I got very overwhelmed and SH to the point where I had to get stitches. It was very traumatic for me and my fiance... he's been nothing but supportive in trying to help me and I've been trying so hard to get over the shame I felt from relapse. I'm in a dark place and I told my best friend of 15 years what happened. She knows I struggle with BPD and she was like " Let me know if you need to talk, I'm here for you" yet if I don't reach out she hasn't checked on me or anything. It makes me feel like shit because my fiance thinks I'm okay and she seems to think I'm okay but I am not okay. I sl!t my wrist last month I am not okay I am hurting and I am all alone. I know it's alot I don't expect my friend to drop everything but we even work together and usually talk every day but she hasn't checked on me, only if I bring it up. I'm sorry this is all over I'm just so sad
