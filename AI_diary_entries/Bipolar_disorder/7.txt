I woke at 4 a.m. with the feeling of being abandoned by my family. Feeling left out of Mumâ€™s 70th party. No family had yet visited me in hospital (though most interstate). Less worthy of attention and care because I am partnerless, family-less, childless and once again in a mental hospital just like my deceased aunt, the former bipolar black sheep of the family. Am I now to take over that mantle? Am I too difficult? Am I selfish, abrasive, vindictive and divisive? The anger, hurt and abandonment festered. I fired off four lengthy messages to Mum at 5:56 a.m.
