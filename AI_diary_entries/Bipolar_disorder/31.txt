I get extremely frustrated sometimes when no one seems to care about me. Is that weird?

Like tonight, one of my friends is having a small games night for her birthday. (all my friends are work friends - veterinary)I said I wouldnt be going a few days ago because Ive not been doing too good. She said " no pressure Aimiee!" and that was that... no like " oh no are you ok?"Fast forward to yesterday all my friends at work were like are you going, and I said no. ONE of them did ask if I was ok as she saw my message but we didnt go into too much detail cause.. work.But no one else gave a shit that I didnt want to go (I usually LOVE games nights, this is very out of character for me not to go and I even host a lot of games nights too so should have been a red flag if they cared enough?)Obviously theyve all gone tonight and I just feel lke...why did no one try and persuade me to go/ask if im ok etc etc.
