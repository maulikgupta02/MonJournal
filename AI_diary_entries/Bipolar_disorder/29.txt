I am male brazilian 22 and I feeling a little scared about commenting on reddit.

There was a meme that a guy posted it was something loke that "What would chose a Night with this female character or a dinner with this brazilian youtuber" So I wrote on the comments " I would not dinner never with this guy, he is boring" because I do not like his style , even though he is pretty famous and he is so unfunny.

Anyway so the op went on my profile to search about me then answered in the comments: " ok bpd"

Like this was some kind of cursing...

I am scared of people.

Edit: Thank you for all the support. TBH what really makes me so bad it is to think that maybe people in real life will never like me because of bpd
