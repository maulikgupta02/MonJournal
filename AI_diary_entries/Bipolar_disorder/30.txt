I’m empty from all the misunderstanding people project onto me, their pseudo intellectualizations of my character, feelings and emotions, their blatant failure to see me instead of just assume me. Everything is my fault, I’m always the problem. I am not allowed to be anything other than endearing and in awe & accepting of other people’s opinions of me, I always have to agree and never express hurt, anger or frustration. If I do I am a “professional victim” if I answer honestly about how I feel I am somehow being willfully uncooperative. I can’t be anything. It feels so trapping like I’m in a glass box. Anything other than blind belief means I’m petulant, there’s no room for disagreeing. Nothing I feel is ever warranted it’s just internal, all me , my fault I can never be hurt, I’m always at the core of other people hurting me. Everyone’s clear and I’m the one with the glaring red hand. Every interaction or response you have to people is you, people confirm this. I feel more lonely with my best-friends than I do by myself. It’s assumed that I think I’m right and they’re wrong but they say these things with the exact same assumption that their right and my perspective is unviable. Every effort I give is undermined , I am never doing enough. I am exhausted of people doing what they accuse me of, they say I think I know everything when all I do is ask questions. They think they have me figured out they know nothing about me but they sure do like to tell me how and why I am and discount any perspective I might have. At this point it’s karmic people hate confronting me, they would rather me to be dead than look them in the eye. I can’t even be, I’m not given permission too. Why is everything my fault? It weighs heavy on me. I am not allowed to have emotions. I don't even need understanding I need acknowledgement.
