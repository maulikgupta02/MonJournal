Woken up before 7 and back into the familiar hospital drill of shower, breakfast and walk. Almost exactly the same as my previous Sydney hospital. I still haven’t connected with any fellow patients; hesitant to do so before I’ve settled and knowing how fast and deeply I connect. Instead I focused on my therapy group sessions.
