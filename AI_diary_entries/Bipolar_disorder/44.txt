I have always had odd Jobs. Security officer at museums, nanny for millionaires children, uber driver and now in property management. This job by far is the most stressful but money making job I've had. Is it just me or do people with BPD have a love/ hate realtionship with their job? I really think for me its the people im around. There are some really greatful people I meet and than some difficult people that trigger me. I only want to quit my job when I meet difficult people. "Sadly ma'am I cannot recreate the whole parking lot and make a few extra parking spaces, by shrinking all the other parking spaces....this is downtown, the parking spots are all assigned (one per person) and included in your rent. Im sorry you have two BMW's and a Mercedes. "

I was talking with a good friend of mine who has had a run-in with CPS over their children. CPS asked their partner if, "they had any diagnosis that CPS should know about?" Their partner answered with a, "Yes, I think BPD," and CPS responded with, " Oh no. That's a major red flag. People with they diagnosis are controlling and violent."

CPS is actually using BPD(not confirmed by diagnosis just having alot of the markers) as evidence that my friend shouldn't be involved in their children's lives.

Am I wrong? I don't think they understand what BPD is because my friend is super anti-violence and has NEVER been violent with their partner,children and other people at all.

This just seems to wrong. I feel angry and frustrated by CPS basically claiming that BPD makes someone VIOLENT and CONTROLLING????
