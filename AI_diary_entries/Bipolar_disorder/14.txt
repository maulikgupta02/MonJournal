My councilor/therapist Carla has helped me up the hill, metaphorically. By addressing my bipolar disorder and steering me towards seroquel, I was finally able to take the biggest weight off my life; the extreme hatred.

I still have the urge to burn down the DNC building, it’s just not strong like it was before. I’m more myself. I’m also avoiding the internet as much as I can and I’m taking my medicine daily, which is half the fight. The medication makes life easier, but I’m still tired all the time. At least I’m sleeping.

I’m getting better, day by day. One of the things I need to work on is forgiving my mother and father and figuring out how to forgive my greedy aunt. How do you forgive a robber? A crook? A thief? I absolutely despise my aunt. I imagine so many dark things about her over what she did. I can’t let go of it. Her greed and my surprise of her very nature, a selfish nature I had all but forgotten. She was a worst mother than my biological. At least my own mother loved me conditionally.
