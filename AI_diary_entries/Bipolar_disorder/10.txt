Oh M. So broken. So unsupported. So punitive against himself. Exhausted from trying to take care of and please others. Still that unprotected little boy helpless and cowering under the stairs: just fighting to survive.

Tears fell perfectly down his face as he shared his pain of being refused his only real life desire to have children. My heart broke. This beautiful, aching man who no one had ever bothered to look after. All he wanted was to be held by those who loved him. But now a few of us were by his side trying to comfort him and gently correct his cognitive distortions by suggesting this was his illness talking: the polarized nevers, the all-or-nothings, the hopeless future, the lies. When I was sitting contemplating my own demise, I felt them too, except I felt that I would never be in a relationship, never reconcile my faith and my sexuality and would always feel this way. But it was a lie. I told M I also had to reconcile myself to not being a father. I am not sure if that was helpful to hear or not. From across the abyss, I wanted him to know he wasn’t alone and that he was worthy of great love. M’s soul seemed to lift and the grip of annihilation loosened. His life would again be for the living at the end of the day.
