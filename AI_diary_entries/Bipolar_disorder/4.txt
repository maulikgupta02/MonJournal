This day was most memorable for meeting M and E. This happened in the second group of the day which was a dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) self-soothe group. The first group of the day on acceptance and commitment therapy was sold out and so it was I came to the DBT group. However, the facilitator allowed two final people to enter the room: a woman who immediately declared that she was happy on the floor giving off immediate, kinetic sexual energy, and a tall bespectacled guy who was very handsome in a dry way. He had a faint, throaty voice that sounded like it was being stifled. Again, I had to moderate my verbal participation in the group because I had done self-soothe twice before and had a self-soothe box sitting at home. But when the facilitator asked us for examples of self-soothe that we already use, the girl on the floor described how when she was in the most profound pain, she would run water and place objects under it to capture all the nuances of possible sound and soothe her broken soul. So beautiful in its soothed agony.

At dinner, this duo came and sat at our table and their names were revealed to be M and E. Soon, I’m not sure the context, M began talking about how he had just been transferred from the ICU. The way he said it I knew immediately he had survived a suicide attempt. I felt a surge of compassion. Not just a male suicide statistic, but a survivor standing in front of me. Seated at the table, there was an immediate disconnect between the act of suicide and the very smart, very funny and insightful man seated next to us. But why a disconnect? My own experience of protracted mental health disintegration has proven without ceasing that even the one you never expect can be depressed, can self-harm, can contemplate annihilation and can be diagnosed with BPD (“you’re too nice to be borderline”).
