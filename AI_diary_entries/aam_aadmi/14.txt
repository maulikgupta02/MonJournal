Today was a bit of a frustrating day. I had a meeting at work that didn't go as planned, and I ended up feeling pretty down about it. I tried to remind myself that setbacks are a natural part of the process, but it was still tough. In the evening, I went to a boxing class, which helped me release some of my pent-up frustration. It was a great workout and I felt much better afterwards.
