Today was a bit of a mixed bag. I had a doctor's appointment in the morning that ended up taking longer than expected, so I had to rearrange my schedule for the day. It was a bit frustrating, but I tried to stay positive and make the best of it. I ended up having a productive day at work and even managed to squeeze in a workout at the gym. In the evening, I went to a book club meeting with some friends. We discussed a book that we had all read and it was fascinating to hear everyone's different perspectives. I'm always amazed at how a single story can be interpreted in so many different ways.
