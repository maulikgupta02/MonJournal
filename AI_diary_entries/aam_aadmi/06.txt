\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Today was a tough day. I woke up feeling anxious and couldn't shake off the feeling all day. My heart was pounding and my palms were sweaty. I tried to distract myself with some music, but the anxiety only intensified as I got ready for work.\
At work, I couldn't concentrate on my tasks. My mind was racing with thoughts of what could go wrong and what I might have missed. I felt like I was on edge the entire time, jumping at every sound and constantly checking my phone.\
During lunch, I tried to take a walk to clear my head, but even the fresh air didn't seem to help. My chest felt tight, and I couldn't stop worrying about everything. I was convinced that something bad was going to happen, even though I knew it was just my anxiety talking.\
In the afternoon, I had a meeting with my boss, and my anxiety went into overdrive. I was afraid I would say something stupid or that my boss would notice how nervous I was. The meeting went okay, but I was still shaking afterwards.\
After work, I went to the gym to try and work off some of the anxiety, but even that didn't help much. My thoughts were still racing, and I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread.\

\cf2 \cb3 \strokec2 Now, as I'm writing this, I'm still feeling anxious. I know I need to try and relax, but it's hard when my mind won't stop racing. I hope tomorrow will be a better day, but for now, I just need to take things one step at a time.\
