I had a really fun day today! I went to the beach with a group of friends and we spent the whole day swimming, playing volleyball, and lounging in the sun. It was so nice to just relax and enjoy the company of good friends. We even had a little bonfire on the beach at night, which was a great way to end the day. I love being near the water - it's so calming and refreshing. I feel so grateful to have friends who are willing to take a day off and spend it doing something fun and relaxing.
