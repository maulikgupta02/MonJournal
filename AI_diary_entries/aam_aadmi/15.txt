Today was a day filled with new experiences. I tried a new restaurant for lunch and ordered something I had never tried before, and it was delicious! In the evening, I went to a painting class with a friend. Neither of us are particularly skilled when it comes to art, but we had a great time and even managed to create something we were proud of. It's easy to get stuck in your comfort zone, so it's important to push yourself to try new things every now and then.
