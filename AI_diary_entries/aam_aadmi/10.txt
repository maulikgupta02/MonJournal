Today was a pretty low-key day. I spent most of the day at home, catching up on some reading and doing some work around the house. I find that sometimes it's nice to just have a quiet day to yourself, to recharge and get organized. In the evening, I went for a walk with a friend and we talked about our plans for the future. It's always inspiring to hear about other people's goals and dreams.
