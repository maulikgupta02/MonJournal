\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Dear Diary,\
Today was a pretty tough day at school. I woke up feeling groggy and tired, which didn't help my mood. I had a math test first thing in the morning, and I was feeling really anxious about it. I studied really hard last night, but I still felt like I wasn't going to do well.\
During the test, I started to feel really overwhelmed. My mind went blank, and I couldn't remember any of the formulas I had studied. I started to feel really frustrated and angry with myself. By the time the test was over, I was in a pretty bad mood.\
The rest of the morning went okay, but I was still feeling pretty down. I had lunch with my friends, but I didn't really feel like talking much. I just wanted to be alone with my thoughts.\
In the afternoon, we had gym class. Normally I love gym, but today I just didn't feel like it. I was feeling really tired and unmotivated. I ended up just going through the motions, not really putting in much effort.\
By the time school was over, I was feeling pretty exhausted. I just wanted to go home and curl up in bed. But I had to stay after school for a club meeting. I didn't really feel like going, but I didn't want to let my club members down.\
The meeting ended up being really fun, though. We worked on a project together, and I got to spend some time with my friends. By the time I left school, I was feeling a lot better than I had earlier in the day.\
Now that I'm home, I'm feeling pretty tired. I'm going to try to get some rest and take care of myself tonight. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.\
