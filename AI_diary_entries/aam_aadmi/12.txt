Today was a bit of a sad day. I found out that a family member passed away unexpectedly, and it was really hard to process. I spent most of the day with my loved ones, reminiscing about the good times we had with the person who passed. It's always tough to lose someone you care about, but I'm grateful to have a supportive family to lean on during difficult times.
