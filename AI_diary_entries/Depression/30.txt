I’m lucky to have an amazing loving girlfriend and few good friends and loving and good family. Just wanted to clarify so I don’t seem completely ungrateful

I hate having feeling this way completely lazy unmotivated and tired most of the time, my sleep schedule is bad over the past few months where my depression has gotten downhill (same with my life) I’ve noticed im gaining weight way less active than what I use to be less athletic and no ambition in my life.

Im 18 I don’t do any education or have a job and I do want a job for money and being able to help my family out but at the same time I don’t want one at all feels like alot of pressure ways to drown me in more of my depression and anxiety I genuinely feel so lost for the past 5 months I have legit done nothing but play video games and spending time with my girlfriend.

It’s easy saying get a job or get back into college but for me actually going out and doing something is something I’m not use to and not sure how exactly what to do to what im doing.

I feel like I need to have some sort of a control over something my anxiety fucks me

As well to mention I have no gsce besides from English barely any qualifications

My life feels so fucking out of control I feel so lost and empty I don’t know what to do
