I made a new friend. He said he liked my shirt, so I told him I liked his shoes. We started talking about school and how we can’t wait to graduate one day. He was nice to me and he even made me smile a few times. I was shocked. I couldn’t remember the last time I had a genuine smile. It’s been a while. I hope we stay friends.
