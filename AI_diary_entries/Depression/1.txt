Anyone else struggle to open up to friends and family...? I feel like I'll burden them with the weight of my issues... or that they'll leave me because I struggle. I think it stems from the fact that it has happened before. People get tired or hearing my struggles and leave... which I don't blame them for, but as a result... I don't want to open up to anyone I'm close with. So, what do I do? I try bottling it up, but that only makes me numb. Once I get sick of being numb, I try to vent to strangers. It actually helps, only problem is if they want to become friends afterwards... they know all my problems now. It's a double edge sword. Unless I pick the path of being numb. Am I the only one who struggles with finding a good place to vent? I know therapy is a thing, but I've had bad experiences with therapists, plus it's expensive. So, what do you do?
