I’m 17 and I live alone because both my parents don’t care about me, everything is building up to the point where I don’t want to live anymore. I’ve asked God to kill me multiple times and it seems like when I need people the most no one’s there. I feel alone. I know that a lot of people on here feel the same way, I guess I just need someone to relate to. Everyone says “you’re not the only one” but it seems like everyone around me has what I want the most, parents. On top of that this school is trash and I don’t feel that I have any real friends here. I hate distracting myself from my depression just for it to come back stronger the next day. Shit my counselor won’t even answer my messages. Am I worthless?
