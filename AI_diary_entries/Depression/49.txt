It was a great day. Jake came over to my house and we studied. My mom was shocked when I asked if a friend could come over. I could practically see the light that came into her eyes. I realized how much I longed for that look. I want her to be proud of me. I never want to see her cry again. Studying was always boring to me, but with Jake, I donâ€™t think anything could be boring with him.
