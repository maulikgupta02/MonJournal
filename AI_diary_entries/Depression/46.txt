My therapist told me it might help me to start writing down my thoughts every now and then. I’m not entirely sure how writing down stupid words on a piece of paper will help me at all, but who am I to judge? She’s the professional after all. I’m not sure how to even write in a diary. It all seems so childish, but if it gets my mom and therapist off my back for a while then I will do just about anything. So diary, I guess I’ll start off by saying why I’m in therapy. They say it’s because I’m depressed, but I don’t think it’s true. I feel like depression is when people feel sad or angry for a long period of time. I feel nothing. I’m not sad or mad. I’m not happy either. I feel nothing; I am nothing.
