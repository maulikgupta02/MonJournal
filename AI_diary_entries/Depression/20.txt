i am a fourteen year old girl in high school and currently grounded for over a year and half due to drug use getting raped and mental issues they don't think i did but oh well. all devices got smashed n currently on a fire stick tv hating myself and mentally/verbally abusive guardian . he tells me the reason im still living at home is cause no one wants me or nowhere for me to go. i cant say it all at once cause its longer then a dictonary and tv typing feels like a job
