It's become so hard, pointless to get through each day. It's just suffering. It's just pain. The world seems a very uncomfortable place. Trying all I can, doing whatever might help but nothing's working. I just wanted to vent my helplessness and how hard it has become to live. Can't do this anywhere else.
