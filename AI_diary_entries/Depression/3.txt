 feel like life just happens to me and I’m never in control. Im a 29 year old single guy going nowhere in a hurry. Ive tried but I just can’t get a grip or man up and take the reigns. I’m just so tired.

Got laid off from my job this morning. Now im sitting in this coffee shop with my thumb in a cup of ice from a bee sting lol. I know i know… “Oh woe is me”, i hate feeling like a whiney little child. I’m nowhere near where i want or should be. Every time i think something good is coming my way, it goes away or I can’t hang onto it. How is it that other men have the strength and ability to fulfil their ambitions, provide and be the pillar of their community? How do i become that? Will it ever get better?? I guess a better question is, how can I make it better?
