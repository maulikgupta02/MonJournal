I haven't wrote in here because I had to go somewhere for a while. I did something really bad. I shouldn’t be here right now. I shouldn’t be allowed to write in this stupid book because I should be dead. I hurt myself, but I think I broke my mom forever. She is scared to talk to me, scared to say the wrong thing. I don’t know how to tell her that it’s not her fault. I’m starting to think it’s not anyone’s fault, not even mine.

Dear Diary,

Ever since the attempt a couple of months ago, I have been seeing my therapist more and taking new medications. I have been doing better and I’ve been learning a lot. I understand why Jake ended things. I understand what my therapist was trying to tell me all those months ago. I tried to use Jake to fill the parts of me that felt empty. It felt good, at least for a little while. Depression isn’t like a cut on your skin. You can’t slap a band aid on it and wait for it to heal. You can’t use a person or an item to fill the holes that depression has left in you. I’ve realized that I couldn’t love Jake the way he deserved because I didn’t love myself the way I deserved. I’m working towards loving myself now, even in the bad moments. I know now that depression isn’t a straight line. There will be zigs and zags, but I know now that I’m not alone in it. I have people all around who go through the same thing and I have people who love me. There was never anything wrong with me. I will get depressed sometimes. I will feel empty sometimes. I will get sad sometimes, and I think that is okay.
