I need to submit a 4-page paper in the next 4 hours, otherwise, I would fail my class. but instead, I'm here to vent about how much I hate life in general and in particular and in every way possible.

but mostly, I hate me. This paper, for example, was due on Monday. it is Friday and I still haven't written a single page. and no, I wasn't busy. I was just being my procrastinating self. it is also 4 am and idk if I can have the energy to type anything down.

Oh and also, this is not the first time this happened. I ALWAYS do this whenever I have a deadline coming up. always leaving things till the very last minute and always ending up doing a shitty job because of that.

now, my problem with life isn't really about my inability to submit assignments on time, it is more about how fucked up I am as a person. whenever I fail to perform any form of task normally, I would get drowned in thoughts wondering why I am the way I am.

all I do is cry myself to sleep, stress eat and procrastinate. like that's literally my cycle of life.

Feeling shitty about my lack of disciple quickly becomes feeling shitty about the lack of love in my life, and how I have the shittiest parents who neither wanted me to exist nor knew how to love me. and how I at this 22 years of age, have not experienced a single moment of love with anyone ever, and how I am so touch deprived and how much pain I feel on a regular basis.

this. mfing. pain. I never thought that being very mentally fucked would result in me feeling physically hurt from how much mental load I'm carrying?

like as if a fucked up brain and a none existing self-esteem and self-worth are not enough...

anywaysss, wasted enough time here. imma go submit whatever the fuck I can and put myself into a coma for the weekend so I don't feel a thing, I hope.

no but wait I just remembered how I am also incapable of finding peace in my own dreams lmfao.

whateverrr...
