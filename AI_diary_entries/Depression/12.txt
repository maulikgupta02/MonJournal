Life is so extremely difficult. I have a negative bank balance, I’m behind on bills, I’m busting my butt going to school full time to be a teacher and working a full time job while taking care of my daughter but it’s not enough. If I didn’t have my daughter, I’d be long gone. All I do every day is just think about ending it all. I’m tired of feeling emotionless. I want to feel joy again. But it all just feels so pointless.
