I've been feeling like crap for a long while, but recently it's been even worse. I feel like absolute garbage most of the time, dread almost every new day, get overwhelmed and overstimulated way easier than I probably should, my self-care is shit, and I've started to self-harm much more frequently. I can't hang out with my friend because he's busy, isn't in the best mood himself, and is always hanging out with multiple of his other friends (I don't like joining in because the only one I really know is him and I always feel like I'm interrupting or something, since they're childhood friends of his and he only met me less than two years ago). The only times I can really say I'm happy are when I'm escaping into a video or game (if I'm in the mood for it), or working with one of the kids whom I absolutely adore, but at the same time that's always in a stressful/overwhelming/overstimulating environment, which really wears me out.
