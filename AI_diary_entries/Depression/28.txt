I've had depression and anxiety for most of my life. I am about to finish a master's degree. At the beginning I wanted to get it but now I don't even want to be in this field anymore. I feel stupid for wasting all this time and money. Everyone says how awesome it is I got a master's but I feel like I just wasted three years of my life and made the wrong decision. I just want to work some basic job and make it through the days. I just don't care about trying and working hard anymore. I have no idea what I'm going to do after or how I'm going to explain it to anyone. Thank you for listening.
