Going through n thinking what's the most efficient way to commit...for example thinking of ways to go... places I looked all over deciding where I can tie the cable n hang from... tie all the knots n make the noose.... putting a stool up n getting to the point of all I had to do is kick it... writing my letter goodbye… but I couldn’t muster the strength to commit…. Some bullshit… No one knows what I'm going through because I don't open up to anyone I hate talking about my feelings...unless it's to strangers or doctors which don't know me... feels like I burden everyone because to me my life is just filled with pain n suffering… no one found out what I did so I’ve been going on as if it never even happened… I’m starting to wonder if so traumatized I can’t feel a thing… should go to the psych hospital?? I had an attempt three months prior n ig this makes my second i have no clue…
