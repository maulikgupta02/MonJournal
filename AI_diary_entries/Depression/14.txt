I Don't Know...

My feelings don't matter. They don't exist, they are inconsistent. Nobody cares about them and no one is obligated to. I finally get that... but at the same time they are trapping me so much and I don't what to do.

Are there some things that have to be told? If I can't let it go, who am I supposed to share them with? I can't tell anyone I know because they don't know what to do either. And i'm too afraid to reach out to anyone that would know because I know that I wouldn't be able to learn fast enough, I would just ghost them and feel ashamed.

I don't know what i'm supposed to do. I feel uncomfortable in my own comfort, but if I see a way out I plant my feet even deeper because I make up all of these scenarios and excuses.

I don't know what to do.

Who am I supposed to be? I fucking hate it. I hate that i'm such a little bitch. All I do is whine and complain and do nothing. I'm the average, i'm the fraud, the negative influence. I want to off myself and I can't even answer whether that is selfish or not. Yet at the same time, i'm too afraid to go through with it.

I plead to be someone else while there are people who have and do suffer far more than me and still get ahead despite it.

I want to give up. I want to throw myself away. I can be anything and anyone, I can do anything, and here I fucking am- bitching. I want to be left behind but whose fucking choice is that? Mine.

Why should anyone have to care about me? To them, I just will tell them not to, then turn around and cry when they don't care.

I am everything I hate, I do everything I know I shouldn't. I cannot be anything good for anyone at this state.

I need help- but i'm too selfish and egotistical to get any. I want to help others- but I "can't" for the same reasons and worse.
