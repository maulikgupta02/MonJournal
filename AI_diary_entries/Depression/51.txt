I can tell Jake is getting upset with me. I haven’t wanted to do anything for two weeks. He wanted me to go to a party with him, but I don’t know how to tell him that I can’t do it. I couldn’t tell him that it feels like I am drowning and can’t seem to get back up to the surface. Jake, being the guy he is, doesn’t go to the party. He sits next to me and holds my hand. He asked me what’s wrong and I used the same excuse that I always do, “Nothing. I’m just tired.” How can I fix this? Why can’t I just feel happy again?

Dear Diary,

The emptiness has taken over again fully. Jake broke up with me. I feel like I can’t breathe. I can’t eat. My mom cries again and I feel nothing. I guess Jake finally had enough with my mood swings. He stood in front of me, his eyes no longer holding any light or warmth, and he tells me that I drag him down. I suppose I deserve it. I do drag everyone down, even myself. I didn’t even cry when he broke up with me. Is that normal? I don’t think it is, because in movies, a character always cries when their heart is ripped in half. What is wrong with me?

Dear Diary,

I’ve been forced back into therapy again. My mom is worried. I thought my therapist would tell me that she told me so, but she welcomed me back with open arms. We talked about the breakup and what lead up to it. I told her I don’t want to feel this way anymore and she tells me that it takes time. I told her I want to be normal and she told me that I am normal, that people with depression have bad thoughts, but it has nothing to do with the person. I don't know if I believe it.
