Hello, i have a severe depression for years now, i was extremely suicidal but with proper medication i am not suicidal at all anymore. So for a first time in a long time i was feeling normal, i have not felt like this for such a long time i forgot what was it feels like, until this guy texted me out of the blue, i am not close to him at all, and we had good conversation until he said that i seemed depressed and then i opened up to him, i told him about how i suffer and etc. And he told me that i fake it, i want to be mentally ill bcs it's edgy or smth, and i have a down syndrome and i am a stupid person, i asked him why was he telling me that and he said that i am the most pathetic, pitiful person he has ever met :| I don't know why sometimes people can be this cruel, just why? What was the point, I don't understand, i think he did this on purpose i know that evil people exists for no reason, it was pleasurable for him but it's absolutely terrible for me, now i feel absolutely terrible and shitty

Anyways i wanted to tell this to someone, So i swear i will never open up to someone ever again, i learned my lesson, only on this sreddit, bcs you all kinda know how i feel, and i think there's someone who experienced simillar thing. (Btw i didn't do anything wrong to him ever)
