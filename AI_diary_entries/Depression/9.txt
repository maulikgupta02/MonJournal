I dunno, dude. I don’t wanna talk to my parents about this, as they already do a lot for me. I just sometimes just think if I disappeared from this world nothing would change. All my other friends are doing cool stuff, have better grades, and all that stuff. I want to die, but I’m to scared to do it, but also, like, I don’t want to die. I can’t describe these feelings, I just don’t wanna feel anything anymore. I don’t wanna hurt others in any way by burdening them with my existence. Are there any ways I can deal with these things as a 13 year old without bothering any adults?
