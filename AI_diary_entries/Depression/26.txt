for some reason i always feel like “venting” about my problems on here but not wanting any advice and rejecting anything positive because i tried to accept positivity and help and i went back to the way i am over and over again,by the way i work out and have 2 therapists and take medication everyday
i dont know what this means. it’s like a cry for help, but without tears. because i made up my mind to kill myself one of the next weeks and i know how. i always feel like letting it all out here, because i got nobody to talk to casually. but i’ve made up my mind about it and i am definetly not gonna stay alive over 18. PLEASE do not try to talk me out of this and make a big deal or guilt trip me bcs my fam would be say because it’s only making it worse.thank you for listening to my vent.
