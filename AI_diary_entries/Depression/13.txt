I don't know if this is the right place to be doing this but tbh I have where else to go. I've always had a history with sadness. I don't want to say depression because how would i know? but ever since i could remember i've hated myself. When i was in hs i used to self harm, and when my mom found out i stopped out of embarrassment. i've relapsed once or twice, but recently i've had this crippling feeling of lonliness and sadness. I can hardly get out of bed to use the washroom or eat, even when i do get out of bed things like eating just aren't important to me or just feels like too much work. I can't do my school work, my body and braid just won't allow it, and this causes more sadness because of the anxiety of failing school and being worthless. Life just feels very heavy and i hate who i am, i don't feel like i have a future. I have no goals or real accomplishments and the friends that i have i just don't think are my people, i feel like i don't have anyone. I've never been able to talk to anyone about this because first of all i don't think anyone really hears or listens to me, and second its embarrassing. I hate the feeling of people feeling bad for me, so i suffer in silence. I've done this my whole life. How are some people just okay and happy with their lives? how do i get there? i feel like there will always be something or i'll always hate myself and suffer alone,.
