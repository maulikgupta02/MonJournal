Alright I have to get this out, basically my mother had gaslit me for a long time, taking control over my life and emotionally abusing me by always blaming me for everything and getting my father on her side so that he would blindly support her. This went on for multiple years and stopped at some point (as far as I know, Idk if I have just gitten blind to it) it was not too long after all of it that she started saying that she could not remember any of it, this has gotten to a point that I even started questioning my own memory of my childhood. I often find myself questioning if I remember something right just because of this and I can't really get myself to trust her 100% even getting scared of her sometimes that she might do something to me.

I also remember wanting to jump out the window at like age 10, the intend was there but I think it was also to see if my mother cared. I ended up not doing it because her reaction was just nothing, I didn't expect her to just not care at all.

I also had a lot of pressure due to my grades being very bad, I at one point got even worse grades due to me trying to escape into my fantasy, that did go on for about 2 years, therapy could have helped but no one thought of that. My grades eventually got better and I graduated and am now at university.

I'm currently trying to get therapy and hopefully come to terms with everything in atleast some way.
