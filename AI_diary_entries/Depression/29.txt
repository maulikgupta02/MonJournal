Except maybe shopping. I'd never actually buy anything, I love imagining what I'd do with a camera, I actually really need a desk organizer too. My house is fairly organised, but nothing interests me anymore. I used to love animals. Now I'd see the most beautiful bird and I'd not feel any happiness. All I'm worried about is my future now. I tend to take it out on my boyfriend too. I dread cooking and washing clothes now. And I'm too broke to buy food and go to the laundry. I'd do something different almost every month. I had my 1st camping trip. It stressed me out being with other people. No joke is really that funny anymore. I saw avatar 2 and cried because i really love art. I'm imagining all the opportunities i missed. My degree is so useless i feel horrible for spending so much money on it, well, maybe an art degree is even more useless. I don't feel like talking to anyone, not even my closest friends. Even if i want to, nothing happens that is an interesting convo topic. Honestly i used to kind of get happy to eat, now all i think about is i can't afford it. But the thing is I do afford it, i just don't have that much money as I once did. This semester my only interest is entomology, i find the other 4 subjs really difficult. I feel i can never be "cool" enough. I cannot look at people in the eye anymore. I now fear going to shops i just order everything online my only comfort is my bf , i feel so relaxed when we talk. . Am i feeling sorry for myself? I know, I don't like it either Maybe i have sensory overload. I'm tired of hearing "loosen up" "relax". I just don't like groups I really have to eat healthier. My self esteem is so low now. I wish I were easier to love
