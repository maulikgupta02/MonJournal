I feel so incredibly lonely and I feel like I don't have a valid reason for it. I have friends, I have people who care for me, I got a love interest and yet I feel so lonely...

I could hang out with people next weekend but my brain says I shouldn't go. I have tickets for a party with friends on the 14th but I feel like I shouldn't go. I am planning a trip to visit friends I met online and know for 4 years in 2 months but I think I shouldn't go. I am meeting said love interest shortl, after or during that meet up but I'm afraid to see them.

I'm making my life harder then it needs to be. Like for once I don't hate being alive but I still hate myself and I'm so incredibly sad and unhappy. Like why can't I just enjoy the things I now have?
