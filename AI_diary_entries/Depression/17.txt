I can’t fucking handle it I can’t fucking do it I can’t handle one more fucking person telling me that I just have to see the good times in life. Or to go out and do hobbies and you’ll find like minded people or go out and you’ll make friends. IT ISNT THAT FUCKING EASY FOR FUCK SAKES IF IT WAS DONT YOU THINK I WOULD OF DONE IT DO YOU THINK I LIKE BEING ALONE AND DEPRESSED I hate life so fucking much I hate being depressed I hate waking up everyday in a bad mood wishing it was night so I can go back to sleep I hate having no friends I hate when I try to talk to my “friends” they tell me idk what to tell you can’t someone just help me listen to me I listen to everyone vent I try and help them I’m always the fucking therapist and no one listens to me I have to vent on fucking Reddit to a bunch of strangers because I’m so lonely I’m so pathetic I’m such a loser. No matter what I do I can never be happy no matter how hard I try no matter what pills I take no matter what therapy I’m sick and tired of the generic oh go outside and walk around or read a self help book like please I do feel a little bit better writing this all out tho. I swear it’s the only thing keeping me alive I literally feel so alone. I just want a hug I just want someone who genuinely cares about me I don’t even fucking know anything anymore I’m so hopeless life is hopeless I am hopeless
