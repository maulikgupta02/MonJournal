Nobody knows how close I am just calling it quits every single day. I am depressed and suicidal and when I try to talk to someone they seem to always turn it and make it about themselves. I am tired, exhausted, and I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. There is no joy in life. There is no baseline of happiness or feeling content. Idk what to do anymore. I just want to give up.
