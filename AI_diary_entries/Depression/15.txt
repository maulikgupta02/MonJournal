I really don't know why I keep posting. Maybe it will make me feel better? Maybe I'm crying out for help even though I'm helpless? Maybe it will help someone else not feel as depressed? I have never felt depression like this before. I have been down and sad in the past but this is a whole new level. Maybe it's because I'm getting older and know time is running out. Maybe I'm losing my mind. 36 years old and really nothing to show for my life. I have no family other than my mom, no friends. My best friend, the one I loved so much, moved away and now we don't speak anymore. She kept me company, kept my mind busy and was so sweet and nice to me. I've never felt loved like that before and now it's gone. She probably realized I'm just a lost cause. She deserves better even though I wish she never left... My job sucks, everyone is so mean and rude, all the comments I hear from them, I can't believe people can treat another person like that. I'm sure they can tell how down and depressed I am, its written all over my face. I barely make enough to get by and have no energy or motivation to change my situation. Life is so scary for me... all I want is to move back into my mom's to have some kind of normalcy again, even though I should be old enough to care for myself, but her situation would never allow it. I feel like such a loser, like a waste of space, and everyone knows it I'm sure. Fuck this is so depressing reading what I just typed out. Maybe I am actually going crazy...
