I fucking hate this country. I fucking hate this society. I’m so goddamn sick of all these assholes who are in control of my income, not give one single flying fuck about my mental well-being. All they want is a body to get their job done. I’ve tried talking to the fuckers for YEARS about my struggles, without really going into too much detail (don’t want involuntary grippy sock jail again). Every fucking day I bust my ass at my job. I go “above and beyond” because it’s literally wired into my brain. I could drop dead on the job and the next day they’d have a replacement, and forget all about me. I know so many other people go through the same shit, and it is so goddamn infuriating that we live in such a twisted world. I hate it here. I fucking HATE it here.
