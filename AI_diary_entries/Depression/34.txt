Yesterday at the supermarket

I stole a tube of toothpaste

The day before yesterday I jammed

The neighbor’s keyhole with a wad of gum

Last week I kicked down every single garbage can

In a row outside the neighborhood district’s gates

Each time I do a bad deed life feels beautiful again
