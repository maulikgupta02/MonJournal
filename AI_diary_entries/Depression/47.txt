I saw my mom crying again. I know she wishes I were someone else. She wishes she had a normal kid. The kid who is always smiling, going to sports games, and having sleepovers with friends. It’s moments like these when I wish I could be that for her. I wish I could feel happy. I even wish I could feel sad, because at least then I would feel something. I just feel empty. I’ll try to be better for my mom, but I don’t think I can.
