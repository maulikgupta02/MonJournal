Sensations have the same issue. I love to snuggle and hug people. But on days that my skin becomes even the tiniest bit sensitive, I can’t be touched. Everyone around me becomes fire, an element ready to destroy my personal bubble. And I can’t quite express that I’m upset about being touched, because when I become upset, over anything, my words become noises. I whimper and growl, or I might just burst into tears. It may seem erratic to the outsider, but to me I have been as patient as possible and have reached my limit. And I am so sorry.

I’m sorry for not being able to control myself. I’m sorry for not being able to express my noises and emotions as words. I’m sorry for laughing at inappropriate times, or hyperventilating at equally inappropriate times. I didn’t mean to grab for those, or break that. I didn’t mean to confuse you, or hurt you. I didn’t even really mean to be me. But I came in on opening night without having practiced at all, or even knowing the event. All I have is my improvisation. So if that doesn’t work, you’ll just have to work around me, and I’ll hope for the best.
