I woke up this morning feeling like my heart was racing a mile a minute. I couldn't catch my breath and my thoughts were all over the place. The more I tried to calm down, the worse it got. I ended up calling in sick to work because I just couldn't face the day like this. I hate feeling like this all the time.
