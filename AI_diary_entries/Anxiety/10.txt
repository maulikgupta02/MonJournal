The company that I worked for: "Hey it's mental health week! Here is a pdf on how to treat people with kindness and always be mindful of others and what they might go through!"

The same company after mental health week: "Oh what? You're overwhelmed with stress and you're showing side effects of the workload you're carrying while panicking and taking a breather? Meet me at the office after work because this behaviour is unacceptable and unprofessional compared to your neurotypical co-workers that can carry the job normally."
