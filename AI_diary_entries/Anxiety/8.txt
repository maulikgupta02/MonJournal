I finally got the courage to talk to a professional today for my anxiety. I got prescibed medication and I told my mom, expecting she would be glad for me. She was not.

She got super angry and told me anxiety is not real, and that the medical and drug industries are just a big mafia looking to exploit people for profit. She told me I'm just going to get worse and that the medication will turn me into a lethargic zombie.

Also she didn't approve that the dr. gave me a 2 week sick leave from work and made me feel bad for "skipping work".

I feel so bad now. Maybe I shouldn't have seeked help after all?
