	Just breathe!” “Think positively.” “Worrying only makes you suffer twice.” Ya know, those kinds of saying.

I wish it was that easy. If I could control it, it wouldn’t be called an illness.

This morning I woke up feeling perfectly fine (which is rare), was sitting on my couch reading then all of the sudden, my heart started beating so fast for no fucking reason, and I started hyperventilating. It took like 2 hours to collect myself and I had no idea what that whole episode was about.

So don’t tell me it’s something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: “We mean well”. I get that. But it’s not helpful at all, when we’re venting and your first reaction is defensiveness. Sometimes all we want is to be heard. I know this is irrational, but jumping in with a cure sometimes isn’t the best route.

Also, to all my GAD fellows, thanks for reading & understanding.
