Isn't it just such a wild thought that there are people out there who just live their lives? They're not constantly worrying or feeling overwhelmed. They don't have panic attacks. They're able to do whatever they feel like doing! Like, it's so insane to me there are people who can travel the world, or even just function in their day to day lives.

I've only ever known life with anxiety. Although I guess that's better than living a "normal" life then developing severe anxiety, I just wish I could have known what it felt to be fearless at some point.
