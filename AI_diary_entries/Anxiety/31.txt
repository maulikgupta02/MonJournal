"I went to the doctor today to get a vaccine, and I was terrified the whole time. I know that vaccines are safe and necessary, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen. I felt like I was putting myself in danger by getting the vaccine, and I couldn't trust the doctors or nurses to keep me safe. I ended up leaving the office feeling dizzy and nauseous, even though nothing bad happened.
