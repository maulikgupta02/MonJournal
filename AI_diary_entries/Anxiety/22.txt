I woke up this morning feeling like a wave of dread had washed over me. I couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen. My mind raced with all kinds of worst-case scenarios, and I felt like I was suffocating under the weight of my own thoughts. I tried some breathing exercises and meditation, but nothing seemed to help. I couldn't focus on anything else the whole day. I felt exhausted, tense, and on edge, and even when I was around my friends or family, I felt disconnected and distant. I just wish I could switch off my mind sometimes and feel a sense of peace.
