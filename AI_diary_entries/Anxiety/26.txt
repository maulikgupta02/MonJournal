I had to give a presentation at work today, and I felt like I was going to throw up the whole time. My heart was racing, and my palms were sweaty. I stumbled over my words, and I could feel everyone's eyes on me. I just wanted to crawl under a rock and hide. After the presentation, I spent the rest of the day replaying every moment in my head, criticizing myself for every mistake or slip-up. I know I did the best I could, but it never feels like enough.
