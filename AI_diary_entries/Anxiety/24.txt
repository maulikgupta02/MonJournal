I had a job interview today, and I couldn't sleep the night before. I kept going over all the possible questions in my head and imagining all the ways I could mess it up. By the time I got there, my hands were shaking, and my heart was pounding. I don't think I did very well. After the interview, I couldn't stop thinking about all the things I should have said or done differently. I felt like a failure, and I was convinced that I would never get the job."
