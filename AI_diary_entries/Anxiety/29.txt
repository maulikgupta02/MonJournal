I had a fight with my partner today, and now I can't stop obsessing over it. I keep replaying the argument in my head and thinking about all the things I should have said or done differently. I feel like I'm at fault for everything, and I can't shake the feeling of guilt and shame. I hate feeling like I'm not good enough or like I'm constantly making mistakes.
