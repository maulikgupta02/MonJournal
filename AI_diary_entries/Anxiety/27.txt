"I was driving home from work today, and I started to feel like I was having a heart attack. My chest was tight, and I had a stabbing pain in my left arm. I pulled over to the side of the road and tried to calm down, but the feeling wouldn't go away. I was convinced that I was going to die right there on the side of the road. Eventually, the feeling subsided, but I was left feeling shaken and traumatized. I hate feeling like my own body is betraying me.
