I had a job interview today, and I almost didn't go. I felt like I wasn't good enough or qualified enough for the position. I kept imagining all the ways I could fail and feeling like I was setting myself up for disappointment. When I finally got there, I felt like I was in a fog. I couldn't remember anything about my qualifications or experience, and I stumbled over my words. I left the interview feeling like I had blown it and like I would never get a job
