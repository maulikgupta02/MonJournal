I had to go to the grocery store today, and I felt like I was going to have a panic attack the whole time. The aisles were crowded, and I felt like everyone was looking at me. I couldn't focus on anything, and I kept forgetting what I needed to buy. By the time I got home, I was exhausted and shaking. It's frustrating to feel so overwhelmed by something as simple as grocery shopping. I just wish I could do it like a normal person without feeling like I'm going to have a breakdown
