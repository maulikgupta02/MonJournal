The war had been raging in my head for 5 years. I had spiraled downward to living in slums that were dens of drugs and prostitution, ending up homeless. My 16-year-old daughter couldn't associate with me unless for her own sake, I took medication. The rift between us completely ripped me apart. I believed that medication was a condemnation to a slow death, and thought that, to my horror, she had come under the spell of my family, human organ gourmets and others engaged in torture and human trafficking.

A woman working at the women’s shelter where I was staying sent me to psychiatric emergency in an ambulance. In the hospital, after being put into restraints and isolated multiple times, I gave up my 5-year battle against medication, psychiatry, and most of the outside world. I told the psychiatrist, “Do whatever you want with me.” He was quick to respond by injecting me with an antipsychotic.

After a couple of weeks, he said, “You’ll be discharged next week, so you’ll need to find an apartment. If you don’t find one, you can go back to the shelters.” He told me, “You’re capable.” I was not, but I didn’t want to go back to the street. I rented a place that was more than double what I could afford, for 1 month, to give myself time to find decent housing that would be covered by my disability pension. During that month, the shadows of delusions trickled away as I realized that I’d have to start my life all over again, at age 52.

There was little money left over for food, so I ran the few blocks to Chez Doris, a drop-in for destitute women that provides free breakfast and lunch every day. Somehow, running was easier than walking. It was easier because suddenly I couldn’t walk straight, put 1 foot in front of the other. I told the same psychiatrist, “I can hardly tie my shoelaces or wash my hair.” He raised his eyebrows and, without a word, halved the dose of my antipsychotic. I guess the dose was too strong, although he didn’t say so.
