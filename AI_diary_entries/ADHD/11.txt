I was telling a friend that I just want to feel something other than empty, anxious or sad. He said that's why he escapes in video games. I told him it's not that easy for me. I have new video games waiting for me but anytime I want to play it I need pre-dopamine to start the task that will give me dopamine and how if it's late im worried I'll hyperfixate and play until 4am without realizing.

He said don't think about it just do it.

I FUCKING WISH IT WAS THAT EASY.

I've had this voice in my head yelling at me to get off the couch. Take a shower. Go to bed early for once I'm not doing anything worth staying up for. For 45min I been mentally yelling at myself and I'm still on the couch. I fucking wish I can just start a task without thinking

Edit: please stop trying to tell me there is already a drug that has dopamine in it! It's a figure of speech!!! And dopamine can't cross the BBB so it medically can't be in a drug to effect the brain. There are drugs that effect the reuptake and other ways to increase dopamine. THESE ARE NO DOPAMINE IN A PILL. I AM JUST BITCHING THAT ADHD IS A BITCH. I am on 70mg Vyvanse. Did a bachelor in pharmaceuticals and neuroscience. And doing a phd right now related to brain and drugs. I WAS JUST TRYING TO BITCH ABOUT ADHD AND HOW PEOPLE DONT GET IT AND WANTED TO GET SUPPORT BY HEARING PEOPLE RELATE. NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW MEDICATION WORK FFS
