I have to change my life's plans because of my ADHD. My original bachelors is in politics, but politics is such a self-motivated field, and in the last three years since I've graduated I've come to the conclusion that I have no self motivation, that I flounder without the structure of school. Do you know how frustrating it is to not even have the motivation to watch TV or movies? (I mean, I'm sure many of you do). It's frustrating because I excel academically, and I know that I'm smart, but there is something in my brain which is stopping me from doing what I need to advance my career. Coming to the realization that it's my own brain holing me back and there's nothing I can do about it is devastating. So I'm going back to school to go into the medical field because I believe that there has to be enough structure in the medical field to work for me.

The only time I can be motivated to do anything is if it's for a grade, if I'm getting paid, or if it will get me laid. And that sucks for someone who needs to constantly be learning in order to stay mentally satisfied!
