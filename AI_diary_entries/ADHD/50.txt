Does anyone else avoid work by looking at their phone? I work from home and my self loathing has been through the roof because I have so much work to do at my job but even previously simple things like emails or something I don't know how to do sends me off for 10mins at a time to YouTube or Google. Today I ended the week without sending an email I needed to send Monday. I'm so mad at myself and overwhelmed and then I took it out on my husband by being mean and snippy. And granted he's inadvertently pressing my buttons I just feel so grrrr arg!

Guess I'm just wondering if anyone else deals with this and if yes how have you pushed through? I'm on antidepressants which seemed to help a little but this lack of attention span has just got me absolutely wrecked right now.


Finally got tired of masking my symptoms and went out and had to seek help from my psych that I visit for my other issues. I took a test and she already knew the results before I finished it. It’s tough to stomach even though I always knew I had it. How did I go through this for so long. I don’t remember being like this as a child or even a teen, but all I can remember is when I was in college and now. Everyone knows my issues. I can pace a hole straight to china. I’m very fidgety, I have to interject myself in every conversation, I constantly interrupt people. TL;DR, people think I’m a strange dude.
