I forgot to submit a crucial assignment, again. Now all of my efforts are for nothing because I didn't remember to turn my activity in and now it's way past the deadline. My ADHD is only getting worse each year yet I have never been given a chance to get therapy because my parents don't me to. The psych literally showed them my diagnosis 13 years ago and they decided letting me "grow out if it" was a better option. I'm tired of dealing with this without proper advice.
