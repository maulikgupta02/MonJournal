Edit: Iâ€™m sad/glad itâ€™s not just me. Itâ€™s nice to be validated that everyone is fed up with the way the system works, but Iâ€™m so annoyed that we have to just deal with it. Thank you to everyone for the commiseration and encouragement. I will resubmit the paperwork tomorrow ðŸ˜’ but I wonâ€™t be happy about it.

Edit 2: this post continues to gain visibility and I just want you all to know that I stand with you in solidarity. Medical professionals may scoff at how inaccessible the system is for brains like ours, but I see you and I know your pain. If anyone in the know about advocating for more accessible health care is here, please let me know whose tree I need to bark up and I will. Woof woof bitch. Weâ€™re sick of this.
