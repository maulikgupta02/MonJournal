this shortage has ruined my pleasures i feel. this past month all without adderall, still having to go to work just to get enough money to come back to my bed, crash, doom scroll, and ignore all my hobbies and pleasures. im stressed out of my mind and i want someone to confide in, make friends, find a girlfriend now that my life is so much more stable. i just want to draw and paint my nights away but id sooner destroy my back in this broken office chair at home. im impulse buying so much and panicking as i debate what were good purchases or not (they are good, my bank trends show im doing good) im just so lost without my meds and completely reliant on coffee at work. every day is spent just to make tomorrow tolerable, and i cant make any progress on my art or writings or meeting people. as a very socially progressive person i want to call every branch of the governemtn to remove the DEA limitations on meeting demands for adderall but i do not have the energy to do so. i have been unmasked and plain faced at work, totally mute and uncooperative in conversation. i just want to feel capable outside of dishwashing again
