A decade of being on name brand and then the shortage finally hit me. Everywhere was out, even with generics. Thankfully rite aid had generic Sandoz xr in stock. Today was day 1 on Sandoz and not Shire. I have observed that it is definitely working, it is definitely helping me focus but my executive function is lower than usual and I have had a migraine and dry eyes all day. Plus there was a weird sweating episode an hour after taking it.

(Adderall rant) I also have anxiety and reading about how crappy Sandoz has been recently did create some anxious thoughts which possibly could have been side effects from Sandoz as well.

I was able to give a closing argument during a mock trial today (law student) and was successful but my head was pounding the entire time. It feels like I have brain fog but only the feeling, not the effects that come from brain fog.

My brain is quiet and I am able to control my thoughts mostly but it feels like I’m taking a slightly lower dosage than usual. I’m not sure how I know that but it feels like the right way to describe it.

If I had to give a general sense of how Sandoz makes me feel compared to Shire XR, it’s like being hungover but wired at the same time.

It feels like it’s not working, yet at the same time I am experiencing things which arguably suggest it is working otherwise I wouldn’t be experiencing those things. Basically bad side effects and lower than normal executive function.
