I’m very newly diagnosed & newly medicated and decided to share this change with my supervisors at work, on two seperate occasions. I figured I wanted to be open about some life changes because they knew I was going through some rough patches. Upon sharing my diagnosis to two of my supervisors, they both responded with “oh my god I think I have it too!” One even asked me what medication I was on and that “maybe I need it too!” When I told my other supervisor (she was away when I spoke to the other 2) she told me that she was with a girl friend last weekend, who happened to be another teacher, and that “literally everyone is getting diagnosed, especially the boys that jump around” & that “pretty much everybody has it now and everyone’s gonna get diagnosed with it”. I work in childcare so coming from a supposedly inclusive environment, I was annoyed at how passive and normalized ADHD was perceived to be. Almost like the new “it thing”. I don’t think any of them had ill intention but I felt so ashamed and embarrassed, I’m almost second guessing if there’s really something wrong with me.
