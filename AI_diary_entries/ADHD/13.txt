The inevitable happened. I feel very much like i need Adderall to function. Work feels great. I love helping people and setting up their equipment. I was afraid of being "dependant" on the medication but not only does it help with work i can focus enough for getting through school work on the day to day.

Idk if its the ADHD or just me but i am prone to abusing substances but never get addicted to them. Consequently i feel guilty just by taking my medication everyday and am fearful of the withdrawal.

I never felt bad about quitting alcohol. Almost a year sober. I can consume edibles to help me sleep, for a whole week and not buy any til at least a month later, yet the one thats benfitting me truly and helping me live as close to normally as possible, i feel completely terrible about it. Can anyone relate?
