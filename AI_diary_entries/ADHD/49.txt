So I struggle to make decisions and have zero motivation to leave the bed on many days.

So to fix that I need the right therapy/support to help alleviate the problem.

For that I need money cos therapy isn't free and I still need to keep myself alive day to day.

To make money I need to be able to get out of bed and make decisions and commit to things.

I can't get out of bed.

So what the fuck do I do?

If society was a human body, I'd be the appendix. I feel so pointless and I just get in the way. Why the fuck am I even expected to be around any more. It's not doing me any favours is it?

Over 10 fucking years it's been like this. My life has stagnated, things have gotten better occasionally but there was always a price to pay. The mean slope of my life has always been downwards. I've tried so many things, meds, therapeutic practices, asmr, mindfulness, whatever. None of it changes the fundamental fact that I can't fucking function enough to take advantage of them in the first place.

What is the fucking point of a person like me.
