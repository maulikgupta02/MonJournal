I'm on max meds of 70mg vyvanse, and only barely manage. I'm afraid of exploring options for alternatives as this is the second line of meds and been OKish for a few years, and without them I'm a mess of a human, even if with them I'm not above the 'passably functioning' line. I need to be studying atleast 2hr minimum a day but ideally 5-6hr and all this week I've opened the books and loaded the sites, and have a grand total of circa 1hour in 4days. Each night I feel normal, each morning I feel depressed, each afternoon I feel lethargic and lazy. When I do come to life by about 6-7pm, I only want to spend time relaxing, gaming, watching shows with my wife after she gets home from work. I can't seem to get my head to let me study in the evening, because that's the time when society says it's OK to relax. Daytime is filled with guilt and anxious energy whilst obsessing about what I should be doing, how not doing it will cause me greater difficulty and that its really important that I don't fuck up these studies for the exam. I know wholeheartedly that the less I do the more I'll regret and more likely I'll fail will be, yet none of that breaks through and forces action. Its like being loosely tied on the train tracks whilst a train is hurtling towards me in the distance, and I know how to undo the ropes to get off the tracks to safety, yet all I do is look at them and mentally plan it, then glance up at the train, then back at the knots, repeatedly. That train will 100% hit me, and yet I just sit there able to stop it happening but somehow mentally paralysed feeling helpless
