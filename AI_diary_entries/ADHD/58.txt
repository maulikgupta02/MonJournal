I dont know if Im just lazy, but every semester for the past 5 years, I have always gotten to a point of a burn out and not getting anything done. I end up procrastinating or sleeping in all of my free time to avoid doing work. I keep seeing all these missing assignments and just cant bring myself to do them, it starts to effect my mentality for the rest of the semester too. I start seeing assignments that arent due for a while and want to get a head start but I just cant bring myself to do it and feel completely hopeless. I have this constant stress in my mind and at this point I think it might be effecting me physically.

I also noticed that learning has been difficult for me since Covid started, it could have something to do with my own personal life but I dont put in the effort to learn new things like I used to. I find it frustrating when I cant understand something right away. It ends up making me step away from my assignment and by the time I come back to my desk, Im ready to close the tab and do something else. This causes me to never finish any of my work or end up getting back to it days later.
