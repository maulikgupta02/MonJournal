I’m trying to switch to a psychiatrist at my therapist’s practice and the hoops I’m having to go through to get on the psych’s schedule are grating my nerves. I’m already a patient there, why do I have to fill out 5 forms and fax them before I’m even able to be scheduled? Why do they need an additional copy of my license?

I’ve been trying to get this done for weeks and keep getting thrown off course or, as was today, get an email back that I need to do this this way and that another way and send in new copies. I don’t even care anymore.
