There’s a couple of things that let me frustrated about ADHD. But one that is hurting my today is hiperfixating on people that I’m interested in. It’s not love. But It’s like a desperate feeling to get attention and sex. Like, I’m most of the times I don’t have a low self steam, I’m getting a PhD, I have a work and I consider myself an “attractive” woman. Last year I went on a date, had sex, then the guy ghosted me, and the rejection was awful. One month later, and I don’t even care about him anymore. The problem, is that it’s a never ending cycle, now I’m into a guy, and I feel so dumb about investing in a new person, and I end up feeling insecure cuz I always feel that I’m perceived as crazy? I don’t wanna marry, don’t want a serious relationship. Since I was a teenager I would be head over heels with someone, that even really deserved my time. I’m medicated, I go to therapy, I do a lot of stuff through the day, but taking care of my is not keeping me out of daydreaming with my crush.
