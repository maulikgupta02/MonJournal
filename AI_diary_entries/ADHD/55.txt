I am late diagnosed ADHD at age 30(F) I have a lot of coping mechanisms to keep my focused with or without medication, but a huge deal for me to be able to complete school or even to relax is having a clean space.

My wife knows this. We have discussed is until I am blue in the face and yet.

I work full time, go to school full time, take care of the dogs, cats, chickens, I cook and I clean.

I get home and I have to clean up her messes and household chores before I can do anything else.

I am so exhausted that I just want to give up.

I’m so incredibly angry at the lack of help even when I ask. I ask nicely, I try lists, I try schedules. I’ve pleaded with her. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m emotionally and physically worn to nothing.

This week I started just finding a place to park my vehicle after work/school just to be someone where I don’t feel obligated to complete more tasks.
