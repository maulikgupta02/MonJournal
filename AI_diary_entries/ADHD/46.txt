I hate that my whole family won't accept that i have adhd. They refuse to recognize that I have adhd and would rather yell at me for being disorganized, forgetfulness, and "lazy". You think they would pick up on that if you consistently make someone feel like shit and yell at them they'll probably change their ways, but if someone consistently has the same problem and exhibits adhd them maybe there's something else going on. I hate that every time I try to get my mom to take me to get diagnosed she says I'm making excuses for being lazy and unmotivated. Every time she yells and me I just wanna fuck scream at her and punch something. I'm done with all this shit I haven't been able to focus my whole life, I can't physically study bc it's so boring, I can't remeber anything anyone tells me, my rooms a mess, and I lose everything. I get constantly bombarded for losing my wallet. my mom always says that "if you put it in the same place everyday it'll be there"....like I'm sorry I don't wanna be mean but I fucking put it down somewhere and go back to get it and it be gone. This is just a long rant I'm sorry I just can't do this anymore.


Whenever I do something stupid I beat myself up over it for the rest of the day, even when everyone else just lets it go. I wish I could let it go.


Being evicted and and I lost my job before all this. Not having the motivation until to do something until shit hits the fan has always been the worst thing about having adhd for me. I wish the world acknowledged that we struggle sometimes.
