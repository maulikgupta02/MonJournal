I have severe GAD and am newly diagnosed with ADHD (combined type) by a neuropsychologist. I’m having trouble expressing my ADHD like symptoms in my head to my psychiatrist. I think this may be affecting which meds I’m getting and am worried that I’m not getting the best treatment at this time. Additionally, I am a high achieving woman (going to med school in a few months, was academically and socially successful in college, overachiever/Type A personality), and I feel like my psychiatrist thinks I’m too high achieving to be treated for ADHD at this point. I voiced to her how difficult my time in college was (procrastination, rumination, losing things, inability to finish tasks, time management issues, etc.) despite my outward seeming success. My psychiatrist is changing up my SSRIs to try to “maximize [my] anxiety treatment,” and I know at the end of this, I really just need to treat it with stimulants in addition to my SSRIs. Was on Prozac for 4 years and switched to Zoloft and feel so much worse.
