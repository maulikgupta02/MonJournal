I've been diagnosed with ADHD since age 10ish. The problem is that though I was diagnosed pretty early and have been seeing doctors for a long time(I'm 29), no meds (available to me) seems to work.
I've tried Concerta(on it now and have been on it for the longest but don't really see a big change), Ritalin, Strattera, Intuniv, Modafinil along with different antidepressants. (Sadly Vyvanse and Adderall aren't available where I live.).
When I see posts of people taking meds and seeing such a difference, though I should be happy for them as a fellow ADHDer, there's a terrible part of me that's envious and resentful. I also sometimes doubt if I actually have ADHD, I know meds don't work on a small percentage of ADHD people,but my mom says I wasn't that hyperactive nor inattentive in my early childhood and though my memories are really blurry I kind of agree?
I'm just tired of knowing I supposedly have ADHD for 15 years doing almost everything possible other than medication but still failing miserably in life and the fact that the single biggest treatment for ADHD just doesn't work for me. I just want meds to work.
