Spent 4 hours scrolling YouTube Shorts when I should have been going to sleep.

Put an entire rotisserie chicken in the pantry instead of the fridge. Had to throw it out.

Left my Concerta sitting next to the sink instead of taking it and wondered why I felt so "off" all day.

Used Windex on my kids stained clothes instead of OxiClean spray.

When my 7 year old asked for Tylenol for a head ache, I got it out, and returned to the living room while talking to my husband. I then put the tablets in my 2 year old's mouth. When I realized my mistake, I screamed and scared the whole family. I fished the tablets out of her mouth (she hadn't chewed yet) and she looked so confused and like she was about to cry.

That was probably the worst thing I've ever done because of ADHD, and I had never made that mistake before. I fell down in the floor shaking and crying because I felt like the worst mother alive for making such a stupid mistake. And I realize that a higher dose of children's Tylenol probably would have had no negative effect, but I can't help but think what if I did something worse on autopilot? Has anyone else made crazy parenting mistakes because of their ADHD??
