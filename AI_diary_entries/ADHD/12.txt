I suspected I had ADHD a couple of months ago and I lagged it on turning in my questionnaire of course. I was officially diagnosed a little over a month ago and have been on Strattera. The first week I felt like the drug worked wonders and all of a sudden everything was clearer and I haven’t felt that good in… ever really. That feeling faded after the first week and the next three weeks were ups and downs of irritability and anxiety. I think the meds leveled out because I’ve been feeling pretty good. Except when I start ruminating on the past. Random memories of encounters I’ve had with friends and family and I’ve been connecting those moments with my ADHD. It all makes so much sense now. Everything can be explained from my social distance and irritability. My terrible communication and inability to express myself emotionally. Now I get sad when I think of all of the years I missed. Would my life had been easier and would things be better? Things are improving but if I think too much of the past I just cry. It’ll pass and I have to keep moving forward but it’s hard. I’m still learning how to live with this. If you’ve made it this far thanks for reading. Much love to everyone here.. we’ll be okay.
