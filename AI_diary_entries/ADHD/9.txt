I am spending my days mostly laying around, because I can't get myself to do anything. It feels Like my body is on Strike because everything feels Like a Chore, a ToDo, a should, a must. Hobbies as Well because even though they are fun, I get exhausted so quickly. (I feel Like my brain is vacuuming Up whatever I do INTENSELY and Putting all the collected stuff into a sensory Input bag.)

I am exhausted. I want fun. I want freedom of choice. I don't want to permanently Push, Push, Push myself because without pressure I somehow don't function. I am sick of Not knowing how much time I should spend recharging and how I should spend it. I am also Kind of at my wits End because of all the stuff that needs to be done but Not being able to kick myself anymore.
