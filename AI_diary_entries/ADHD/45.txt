for the past three weeks I've been slowly spiraling inside a very negative thought process. constantly shaming myself for my mistakes and failures, excessively cringing at embarrassing movements from the past, etc. I'm in this paralytic state and feel disassociated from my usual confident self-assured self. I finally figured it out. it was my excessive consumption of caffeine. I usually have a matcha, meds and probiotics and the day is pretty solid (this system has been working for me for the past 1.5 years or so), but the only change I've introduced into my life is the chai latte from starbucks. I'm not a starbucks person but for whatever reason I got fixated on their chai latte, the caffeine from the tea was probably interacting with the meds/making me go over my daily caffeine threshold, this also explains the headaches and sluggishness/fatigue. ah! no more chai latte for me.
