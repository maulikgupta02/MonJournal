I feel like I'm failing at everything. I'm a mother of two young children and life is damn hard. I just wish I could escape into a fantasy world like a computer game or literally an animated TV show. Is that weird? I wish I could live in a TV show or game because real life feels near impossible. And every mistake I'm making, every time I reach a point of not being able to cope, it's noted... I did so well yesterday with the cleaning but still I was reminded of how I hadn't put the kettle on the stand and I should make a conscious effort to do it.
