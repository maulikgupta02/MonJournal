Had an appointment with my psychiatrist today, thinking he would have the results back from my neuropsych testing, but he didn't (even though it's been a month). The person who did the testing was a bit flaky with phone calls and getting the appointment set up and I am 80% certain it will say I have ADHD but was hoping to talk about that with my psychiatrist.

I'm also really nervous about what my psych will want to do med wise. I am on 15 mg Lexapro and 120 mg Wellbutrin XR. I would actually like to get off of both and try a stimulant as I think a lot of my depression and anxiety is rooted in my shortcomings that are a result of it being like pulling teeth to make myself focus on anything. But even increasing my Wellbutrin he is hesitant because he thinks it will make my anxiety worse. Ughhhh wish I had been diagnosed with ADHD back then and never been put on this accursed Lexapro.
