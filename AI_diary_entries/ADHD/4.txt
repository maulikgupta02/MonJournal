Really struggling to feel positive and optimistic about my ADHD. I hate how asking for help with things that should be super easy is so humiliating simply because for some reason, I can't do them.

I hate how stubborn I am to do things on my own and then when I can't I feel even more ashamed to ask for help because I failed with something that should be easy.

I hate how that has a knock-on effect that causes even bigger problems and it becomes even more difficult to ask for help because even though I know it's not my fault, it still feels like it is.

I hate how explaining that something is a "consequence of my ADHD" feels like I'm using it as an excuse and not taking accountability.

I hate looking back and telling myself "if only I'd asked for help right at the start" and how that makes it even more difficult to ask for help later on.

And most of all I hate knowing that whatever criticism I may receive, or the classic "why didn't you ask sooner...", I know I will only hear things that I've told myself 1000 times before, and I still can't explain, because people just do not and will not understand.
