I don’t know how to tell my friends that half the things I do on a daily basis is a result of ADHD. Because I’ve been told by one of them that it all sounds like a list of excuses. Just one criticism from a friend for a strong opinion I had today already made me want to cry, and I ended up apologizing to them for having such a radical opinion (and this is literally just an opinion about a character in a book!)…I sat at my desk from 1 to 3 am jus thinking about all of it and trying not to cry the whole time. I feel so ashamed of myself.
