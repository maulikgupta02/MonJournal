Called pharmacy to confirm they could fill my script.

They said yes, but per policy, I must wait until Sunday.

Today: I get a text saying they're backordered until end of april.

They said they place orders every day but won't know what they have or when. I'm sure they can't release the info because it would cause a mass rush or whatever.

But I can't do anything right now while I focus on this issue because what's the point of calling around if I can't process until Sunday? no one will know what their inventory will be like on Sunday.

Furthermore, I'm not sure if my provider even works on Sunday... so i can't take a proactive action, but my reactive option isn't reliable either.

On top of it all, I feel SO GUILTY, bugging my ADHD doctor (I guess psychiatrist is the correct term, but he's a specialist so i think its more apt).
