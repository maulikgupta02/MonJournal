I don't know if I'm allowed to post here as I have not been diagnosed with ADHD, but I suspect that I might have it by comparing my experiences with diagnosed people online.

I finally decided to ask for a referral from my psychiatrist yesterday to an ADHD specialist and outlined my symptoms and specific examples with him, but in the end all I got was invalidation. He basically told me that he doesn't think I have ADHD since he says that people with ADHD have bad grades as they can't focus in class, but I excel in school. The problem is, I can't focus in class either but I like studying so I have found a method where I self-study at home while watching tv/listening to music so I'm not understimulated. He also says that emotional dysregulation is not a thing in ADHD individuals, and they're usually happy (???????). His final verdict was that I have social anxiety, which I obviously have and he should know lol but a ton of my symptoms do not account for just anxiety.

It was so frustrating and made me even more doubtful than I was before about having ADHD, and it's hopeless that I'll ever get a diagnosis at all since the country I live in does not have an adult ADHD specialist, only kids.
