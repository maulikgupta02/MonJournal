I swear everything in life is getting worse. Finance new car for wife, it’s in the shop for over a week because the radio died.

I have enough trouble doing laundry and now my New washer, less than 2 years old, the balance springs are out.

I spend 3k on fixing my car, and now more shit is wrong, it’s a 2015. My ride or die doggo best friend for the last 9 years has hip issues and I’m having to decide between car and dog car.

My fucking grandma died in January, out of the blue from pericarditis, no warning, haven’t processed that.

My power company is fucking me over and has been double billing me, and now kicked me off autopay and I never saw double charges.

My credit cards are getting behind again, because I’m depression spending, because I’m anxious, because my structure is fucked up, because the Adderall shortage, because I have to make my prescription last 1.5-2 months instead of 1 month.

Like goddamnit. I was doing so good. But shit manufacturing. Shit product with quality name. Now I’m fucking late for a fucking party and my wife just decided she’s not going because my marriage is also failing.

FUCK
