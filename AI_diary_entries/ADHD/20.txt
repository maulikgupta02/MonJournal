Do y’all have any advice for feeling bad about “lazy days”? I don’t know if this is universal but it happens somewhat often to me on weekends and I do jacksquat except sit on my phone all day.

Yesterday, I wanted to go climbing. I woke up at 11, eventually felt awake at 1 and told myself I’d get ready and leave soon. That didn’t happen and I told myself the same thing at 3. And then at 5. And then at 7. And all of a sudden it’s too late to go, and I more or less wasted my day. I spent soooo many hours on the rabbit hole of this SVB thing with opinions, insight, news etc. and looking back, I wish I would’ve just taken 15 minutes to get ready and drive to the gym. I feel bad about it today and I don’t know if I’ll really have time to go again until later this week, and I feel lazy and unhealthy as a result.
