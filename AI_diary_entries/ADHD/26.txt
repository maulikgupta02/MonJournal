I hate that my country reimburse only the children for the meds, and so little for therapy. I have to pay a 100€/month for my meds, and 70€/month for therapy. On a 1000€/month, and that's barely enough to live as is. I hate that french speaking countries are so against mental health. I hate that a fake disorder get more funding, help and consideration that adhd and autism. I hate that it is used to diagnosed people with actual adhd/autism, but it doesn't give them access to meds, accomodations, ressources or calibrated therapy.
