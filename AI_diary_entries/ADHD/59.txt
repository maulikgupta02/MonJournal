I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate everything I’m SO UNHAPPY I’m sick of being miserable and alone and crying and no one understanding. How I go hungry just to avoid grocery shopping because there are too many people in the shop and the cashier will want to be nice and have a conversation and it’s not her fault she doesn’t know and I can‘t explain and there’s people in the queue behind me and there are kids running around and noise and lights and I hate it so much. This morning I just stood there trying to make a decision about what food to buy, nearly walked out with nothing, but managed to buy 2 items, thank god for self-service tills and keeping earbuds blasting music in to my ears. Haven’t eaten anything though because my stomach is in knots.

I can’t do any tidying up in my place, I can barely function in here, there’s so much stuff but I just sit here year after year like I’m emotionally paralysed, not sorting any of it out, I don’t want to throw any of it away, it’s like my security. No one can know any of this about me, the ones I told in the past just said “oh I’m messy too” or “just do a bit at a time” or “I’ll come round and just throw it all away” my god they have NO IDEA.

At work I always take longer than everyone else, I can see them looking at me, wondering why I do things the way I do, I don’t know why I do either. I’ve always been like that.
