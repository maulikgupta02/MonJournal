I feel like universities only see adhd in relation to academics (like fair enough you go there to learn and all) but all the things that students have to juggle on top of their work is a nightmare.

Just one example: getting classes at the start of the school year.

I am not sure if this is done everywhere, but at least in the unis I've seen, every student right before the new semester goes online and tries to get their class at the best time possible and on the best day possible. That just sounds so so stressful, and just the thought of potentially missing the day where it happens is just overwhelming.

I feel like unis can do much better in terms of accommodations/disability services by having things where a student that needs help can have someone to sit with them and help them with planning their school schedule and getting the right classes. The amount of executive function needed to just navigate the uni system in general (aside from learning and social life) just seems so much, and if you have no friends and are living away from family, you're pretty much on your own.

I feel like so much more shld be done to understand how ADHD affects students and how more holistic forms of support would be helpful in getting used to the environment and all the things needed to get adjusted (at least for the first year)

Don't even get me started with booking student housing, cos those are so stressful too and like what happens if you don't get housing???
