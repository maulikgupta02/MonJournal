Not sure if it's adhd related. But I wasn't sure where to put it. But here goes; I am crushed. I have been leading myself on, imagine myself with this woman for over a month. But I never made a move. Because I thought it was improbable. That she didn't feel the same way. So instead, I was a coward, and let myself enjoy her friendship without ever being honest. She's been on a date with someone else today. I feel like an absolute dumbass. I'm glad that my friend is out there having a good time. But I'm crushed that it'll never be me.

The learning moment? I've done this too many times now. I've been working on being braver and taking action. I've got better at standing up for myself. Better at setting boundaries. If I can be more honest when I have feelings for someone in the future, I would be very proud of myself.
