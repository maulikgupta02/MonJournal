Getting out and touching grass would give me energy but I need to eat food in order to have energy to go anywhere or touch grass. And then having social anxiety drains my energy faster when I'm out touching grass. And I also need to eat. But I don't want to. And not wanting to eat is giving me anxiety and draining my energy too. And not going out to touch grass gives me anxiety and makes me feel ashamed of myself and tired. It's a vicious cycle of not doing anything ever.

I'm tired and bored all the time. :)

Anyways even though I wrote all this, I'm going to my volunteer job today whether I like it or not (I like it because I get to pet cats.) and imma force myself to stupid eat stupid dumb food. Wish me luck.
