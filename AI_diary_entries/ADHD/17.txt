My psychiatrist, who was super accommodating about diagnosing me with GAD and prescribing me Zoloft, completely invalidated my experience about possibly having ADHD.

He said that he didn't want me to "limit my abilities" by considering a diagnosis and that people with ADHD have "serious cognitive deficits" that cause him to be conservative when diagnosing. He also provided the example that people with executive function issues, if told to draw a straight line, would "just keep going because they are that impulsive."

He concluded by telling me to "just enjoy college life," and stating that he's seen students with ADHD, and I don't look like them. Since then, I've questioned if I am making the right decision by seeking an evaluation and whether or not everything is just in my head. Being an adult woman makes this process so much more difficult.
