I’m on the verge of dropping out of my masters degree while waiting to be assessed for adhd. I’m feeling really let down by myself at the moment. Obs I have no diagnosis, maybe there is another explanation for my problems whatever. But I feel really gutted at the thought that if I didn’t have to wait 6 months for an appointment that I might have a chance at this degree :(

Basically started a masters degree that leads to a career that means a lot to me, that I feel really positive and excited for.

But I couldn’t do the first 3000 word essay. Ended up crying for 30 minutes on a zoom meeting with the course coordinator where she basically said I wouldn’t be able to cope with the rest of the course and that I should just drop out and get a job, work on my mental health etc.

I really thought I could put my mind to it if I wanted it enough but It’s been so rough. My worst possible thought when I found out that diagnosis would take so long (I spoke to my go a couple weeks into the course because I already couldn’t manage) was that I might not make it that long and have to drop out before even speaking to a psychiatrist.

GP and counsellor were pretty supportive that I should get assessed, and made an exception referring me to student accessibility support without a diagnosis.. student accessibility support chatted with me and were like yeah you’re struggling with adhd symptoms we’ll try to help you… but I’m in such a rut, all my previous methods for getting through uni (panic mode, “just do 10 minutes” etc) aren’t working at all… I just have nothing in the tank

feels like I didn’t get a chance :(
