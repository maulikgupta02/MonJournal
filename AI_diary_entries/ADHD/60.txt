For anyone else who got diagnosed as adults: how did your loved ones approached it? I don't think im receiving the response from my mom as I hoped...it feels like she's downplaying it, and it sucks. I'm trying to get accomodations for my uni but my psychiatrist doesn't want to fill the form required, and my therapist is like "we still need to finish some testing before I can diagnose you". I just cant understand, i can wait for the diagnosis from my therapist but i dont understand why my psychiatrist can't fill a form. So I got frustrated, told this to her and she was like "oh what is the urge? Are you doing THAT bad at school?". Yes mom, yes. I am having a hard time managing my entire fucking life right now. This is by far the worse burnout in my life. I developed binge eating. I cant enjoy any hobbies. And I have been waiting a while to get my meds! I'm making an everyday effort trust me, to go on walks, control my eating habits, sleep more all that but it's getting harder...
