Partly because of the shortage of ADHD medication, I think this made my search for a new shrink much more difficult. I have bipolar disorder (well-maintained) and ADHD (well-maintained)

In my last post, I talked about a nurse practitioner who wouldn't treat my ADHD because I'm not working a full-time job. I know, right? (She was referred to me by my pharmacist at the time, who said she writes plenty)

Next, I accessed "Psychology Today" because they have a "search for a psychiatrist" function where you can filter for people who treat ADHD or whatever. Their "verified" psychiatrist are supposed to be a cut above the rest in terms of outreach, specialties, experience and education.

This brought me to a few providers who work exclusively for 100% virtual companies like Cerebral, Inc. I thought I'd reach out with a short, positive email. I certainly did not want to seem desperate or like a total drug-seeker. I also filled out an online assessment and even though it bounced back with "Sorry, it looks like we're not a good fit for you" message, this company hounded me with emails, links to their company's blog and phone calls to "Meet your new psychiatrist today!"

Well, the psychiatrists I'd emailed through the Psychology Today portal, some of them got back to me, some of them didn't, and it was the Talkiatry ones who didn't. This left me with a less than thrilled impression of Tele-mentalhealth providers.

I'm curious what you guys think of virtual care if you have ADHD or ADHD And something else, like what I've got.

Oh, and I did manage to find a good shrink, but it wasn't thru a telehealth company. I found one who takes Medicare, is comfortable with my meds, the whole shebang.

More stigma? Or less stigma?

I say More, but it's not being done on purpose. It's more like a cluelessness generation Z type thing.
