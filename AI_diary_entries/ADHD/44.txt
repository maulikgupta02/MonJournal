I work in tech and I love my job. However, right now, I’m in a huge, unfeasible, pressure heavy development project, which became like this part because circunstances, part because of bad management decisions from my superiors.

Today (as it happened Friday), I’m on a SHITTY ADHD day. Can’t focus, sensory overload, can’t maintain cadence when trying to do stuff, procrastinating LIKE HELL and honestly just short circuiting.

I have a lot going on right now. Not only with this, but other stuff from work (that really is important for me) and some personal stuff (like planning for a big trip in just a little over a month).

I’m trying to be kind to myself (since apparently this is a coping mechanism), but fuck, sometimes, I really hate having ADHD.

Like, on good days it doesn’t bother me at all. On bad days (as in being hyperactive af, or being like today), it feels like being trapped at the bottom of the ocean and trying to go up.

I hate how I feel like holding back tears, just because I want to do stuff, but my brain just decided that “meh, not today”.

Shit hahaha

If you’re going trough a day like this, just know you’re not alone. It’s overwhelming, I know. But you gotta play the game as best as you can. And sometimes that may just be enough.
