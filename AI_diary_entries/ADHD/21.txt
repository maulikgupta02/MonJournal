I’m so sick of people online and in my life acting like ADHD is “quirky” or “cute” or like it’s as simple as not being able to focus. TikTok has made everyone who’s ever gotten distracted once self-diagnose and those super functioning neurotypical people with “adhd” set an insane standard for how highly they function, on top of worsening the medication shortage with their telehealth doctor scripts 😭
