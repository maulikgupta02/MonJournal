
I feel so guilty emailing him asking him to resend a prescription to a new location...I feel so guilty discussing dose increases even when he is actively suggesting a dose increase is very likely based on his clinical observations.

Now that I've experienced what life is like when I can always have clean clothes and a happy boss, I feel so GUILTY about needing a prescribed medicine in order to maintain this new level of health and security.

I feel so ANXIOUS and INSECURE about my peace of mind and security being unavailable.

It's like with my life in it's best spot, I'm being threatened with the chaos, anxiety, trauma, self hate, and disappointment that came from before diagnosis and treatment.

I'm so frustrated with everything. Ok......I feel a little better. Peace out.
