I'm barely functioning. I have a recent diagnosis (a few months ago) and I have meds which help in some ways but I am burnt out big time. This happens every 2 - 3 years.

In the past, before I knew I had ADHD, I would just go out and find a new job and move on for another 2 - 3 then rinse / repeat. I'm 41 now and this is miserable.

There's a high likely hood I have other things like ASD along with the GAD I have also been diagnosed with. My youngest daughter also has ASD and her and I are very much alike.

I've been going to therapy for quite a while and my therapist and I have realized that the world we live in doesn't do well with those of us with ADHD or whatever. I need a change, but I can't even figure out what I want because I am in an awful mental health spot right now.

My employer claims to be pro ADHD and ASD. They want to hire more of us and even want to put together a policy related to it. However, we all know how that goes. As long as they can talk the talk and don't need to walk the walk all is fine and dandy. I am part of the group that is consulting on this policy and when we brought up that it would benefit the entire company that we maybe should more sick / mental health days, they said it would break the company.

I would guess that if a company that only gives 3 sick days a year (and 2 personal) can't afford to give at least 5 sicks days and 2 personal, then their business model is flawed.

If I keep pushing, I will end up so burnt out that I won't be able to work for a long time. That scares me.
