I am so sick of feeling so incompetent. It’s absolutely infuriating. The things I want to do, the kind of life I want, is not even that difficult. Yet, no matter how hard I try, I just can’t seem to make any progress.

It’s like I’m in a circus act with a bunch of plates spinning on sticks. One plate for cleaning the house, one plate for going to work, one plate for actually doing my job, one plate for cooking dinner, one plate for socializing, one plate for good sleep habits, one plate for hygiene. Sure, I can get one spinning easy. And maybe another. But when I get to plate three you get some wobbles. By plate four I’m overwhelmed. And eventually the plates start crashing down.

No matter what I do to help it doesn’t work. I read the books, I set things up to make it easy, I keep things in my eyeline so I don’t forget, I set alarms and reminders. Yet I still can’t seem to manage anything with any level of consistency.

Sure, the meds help once I start doing a thing. But that doesn’t matter if I never start. I got absolutely paralyzed tonight at the thought of making dinner. It’s a very simple dinner that would take 45 minutes max. It’s not even a lot of steps or ingredients. But I picked up the bag and just froze. Now I’m in my room sobbing because I can’t do anything!

I just wish I knew how to get myself to function even somewhat close to normal. I don’t need perfection but I can’t keep having every mole hill be a mountain. I’m so sick of absolutely everything being so damn hard. I know not everything can be easy all the time but it would be nice if the basics were at least doable.
