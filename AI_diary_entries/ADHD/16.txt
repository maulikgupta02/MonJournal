I was excited to read “the myth of normal”. I’ve been seeing lots of influential ppl that I respect saying great things. But about half way through I had to stop, it was making me so angry. I haven’t come across anyone else with this opinion, is it just me? Did I misunderstand?

What I was understanding is that the writer believes that ADHD IS 100% caused by trauma and is not a genetic condition. The only reason I would have the exact same type as my father is because of his trauma caused me trauma. He specifically states that he isn’t parent blaming, because the parents don’t cause trauma on purpose, but do in fact cause the disorder. This also extends to other neurological disorders, he mentions autism, addiction and schizophrenia.

Having worked with families with children with disabilities, this feels like a scary message to put out there. From my experience, parents tend to feel guilty even when their child’s disability was completely random and there was nothing they could have done. I know my dad feels bad for passing this on to me, even though he wasn’t diagnosed till after I was. If he was told that he caused it after I was born by psychologically hurting me to the point that my brain chemistry changed, I don’t think he would recover.
