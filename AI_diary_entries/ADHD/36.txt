I thought working hard and succeeding in my career would give me confidence if not contentedness

now I’m a time-poor doctor working kinda crushing hours and doing shift-work, and I feel like I can’t establish any kind of social or chore or food or exercise routine, and it’s slowly costing me my physical and mental health. The years feel like they’ve bypassed me. I feel like an imposter to life, not work.

I know I have it great compared to most, I just don’t know how I can still feel like such a massive waste of space after achieving a lot of my goals. If anything my self-efficacy feels lower now than when I was a stuff-up kid. Now I’m too afraid to even open up cheap craft stuff to try new hobbies because I don’t want to waste it and I don’t have the energy to clean it up after and I upset myself when I’m bad at it. Meanwhile at work I’m taking on situations I never imagined I could.

I wish I could just think about myself rationally, without all the frustration
