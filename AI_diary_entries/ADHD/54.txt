I confirmed my diagnosis a couple of weeks ago. At the ripe age of 26. How do you get past the anger phase of grief? I am angry at my fate. As in, why did it have to be me? Why did I have to be born with a broken brain? Can I trade this for asthma or something that people understand and sympathize with? I am angry at my mother who labelled me as clumsy and unreliable my whole life and screwed over my self-esteem, probably irreparably, instead of stopping for a minute to ask why I am the way I am. I am angry at the psychiatrists and therapists I've been seeing for the past 5 years who never thought of this. I'm angry because of the lost opportunities. Because now I have to face the world without the skills I would have accumulated over the years with an early diagnosis, and with so much shame and emotional damage caused by my many "failures" that turned out to be just symptoms of ADHD. How do you get past this?
