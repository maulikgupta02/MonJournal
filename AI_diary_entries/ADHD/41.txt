I'm about to fucking lose it with Talkiatry, they won't give me a straight answer about how much they bill for insurance codes. They have six, being 30-45-60 minute blocks, with and without a pharmaceutical scrip. They're tier-2, so I don't just get a flat copay, I pay 20% up to my deductible. Easy fucking math.

"Well you'll know after your first appointment" I NEED TO KNOW SO I KNOW HOW MUCH TO BUDGET. JUST.

FUCKING. TELL ME THE SIX VALUES AND I CAN DO THE MATH. ANYONE WHO GRADUATED FUCKING MIDDLE SCHOOL CAN WORK WITH A PERCENTAGE.

JESUS CHRIST.
