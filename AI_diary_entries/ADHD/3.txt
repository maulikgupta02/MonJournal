Sometimes I don't know what to say when trying to describe to people (who don't know or don't have ADHD) how it's so hard to do some tasks. How my mind and body just does not want to, even though deep down you know it's important and you just gotta do it. It makes me feel like an absolute piece of shit knowing that I fail or have failed tasks and having a lot of stress and anxiety thinking on how am I going to handle this potential misunderstanding and that I swear I'm not a piece of shit or a failure or a lazy person, I just have ADHD.

There are times I really want to open up to people and explain to them how this thing makes my life go upside down and hope to get some understanding from of them, but it's scary and sometimes I don't know how to go about it. Especially when I've tried and all the responses I've gotten was always about "manage your time better" or "use a planner". Most of the time I just try to think of it as "oh they don't know about it that much so at least I'll try to explain it to them even more." but other times I just want to give up and wish I could just transfer my ADHD to them and let them have it for a week.

Not to mention as someone who got diagnosed with ADHD and GAD a month or two before I turned 20 last year, I felt both relieved that I finally figured it out what's wrong with me and sad because my whole life I've basically accepted that I just suck.

It's not that I'm all of these other negative traits that people have thrown at me over the years, I just can't function normally and this "laziness", "forgetfulness", and "irresponsibility" is actually more debilitating than your average experience with it. So unless you can open my skull, poke around my brain and maybe shove a planner in there, I just want more people to take this seriously.
