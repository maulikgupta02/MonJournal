I’m just so tired of feeling like I can’t get anything done. I have paralysis when it comes to starting a project and I procrastinate on anything that gives me anxiety (which is a lot of things). It seems like it takes me more time to do things than other people. It’s like my mind will subconsciously try to find rabbit holes to go down and distract itself so that I’m not productive. A lot of times if I am getting in the car, for instance, leaving the grocery store, I have to sit in my car and be on my phone for 10+ minutes before I feel like I can leave or go anywhere else. Unless I have an urgent plan that needs to be followed, my mind is all over the place. It makes me feel bad about myself because I think other people just get on with their day and do what needs to be done.


Really hating on myself today. 29, unemployed, fired so many times. I cannot fathom a career Ill ever be remotely good at. I feel like my 20s were wasted and now I have no where to turn to succeed. Ive only ever been good at fun little part time jobs. I hate my stupid brain and wish I was just normal
