"You need to figure this out. You're an adult."

Sure, I'll make sure to tell that to my fucking disability.

I am going to cry, and I'll be damned if I'm going to do it in the Witherspoon auditorium.

I'm not asking you to take on my responsibility. I'm not asking you to do anything extra. I am only asking that you take into consideration that my life continues before and after rehearsal, and most of that time is absolute shit. I am asking you to understand that your work, and the things of yours that I am involved in, are not the most important things. Not to me, and I hope not to you. I am asking you to have a little mercy. To give a little forgiveness. To stop when I make a mistake, take a breath, and say "okay, that happened. what do we need to do to fix it, of anything" and move on.

if you hate me, I am asking you to tell me now, so that I can relieve myself of the subconscious effort of clinging to what respect I have for you, because I am the type of person who can't help but think we'll of people by default.

I'm a useless piece of shit! You don't need to tell me I'm disappointing you, I already know! I disappoint myself far more than anyone else is capable of! But this world I did not choose to enter gives me no choice but to keep up this ridiculous charade, to keep pretending that I am adequate for anything at all, that I can be a functioning member of society, that I can show up to things on time, and make deadlines, and keep track of every appointment. It's really ridiculous, everyone can see right through my act, but I have to keep doing it anyway!

God, am I Sisyphus? condemned to an eternal effort towards a purposeless task, only to be regularly reminded of my inability to succeed?

I'm doing my fucking best. I'm sorry it isn't good enough. Not for you, or for me. I'm sorry.
