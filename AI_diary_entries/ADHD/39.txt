I'm still really new to the diagnosis and I don't take my Ritalin most days of the week out of some weird fear that I've fooled my psychiatrist into believing I have ADHD but then when I'm medicated I just manage to get stuff done and my grades have vastly improved due to my focus in class. (The one time I always mange to get over it and take it)

Instead, what do I do? I drink a six pack before doing a midterm exam to not over think my answers or drink 7 cups of coffee to feel like I have the energy to tame the beast of my wandering concentration. Shouldn't it be obvious to me?
