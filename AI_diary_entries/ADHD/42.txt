I have a successful YT channel that got monetized in 3 weeks last year and has hundreds of thousands of views, and yet I've been "working" on the same video for close to 5 months. ADHD paralysis is a bitch, and I can't seem to get out of it even with therapy + medication. And I know it sounds stupid, but it's like I look at Premiere Pro, and the work I have to do, and I just go "na, I'll do it after watching this vid" which leads to "oh shit I need to call/cook/do xyz".

Worst of all is that I'm still making money from it, which I know could be 5-10x more if I had just uploaded even 1 video a month.
