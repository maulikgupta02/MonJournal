Being a waitress and having a waitress station that blocks out all of my costumers sucks. I will have 5-7 tables at once then 3 of them will need something. A check, boxes and a bag, more to drink. I might go back in the waitress station and remember to grab the check but then the phone rings. Sooo I take down the Togo order and put it in the system. Take the check out to table and see table who needed boxes and a bag but then table 4 stops me and asks me for something. Knowing that I forgot the boxes and bags now table 4 needs me I grab everything taking it to tables 2 and 4. By now it’s been like 10-15 minutes and the table who needed more to drink is finished with their food mad and ready to leave. I wish I could see from the station into the dining room maybe I would remember more of what I was doing. Idk anyone have any advice for that situation. It’s been getting me into trouble at work because my boss with get upset with me if my tables asks them for something after asking me for it.
