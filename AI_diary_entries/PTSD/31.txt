I don't want to drag this on so to put it shortly: my mom did bad things to me when I was little. I visited my hometown and lived with her for a few months recently and it was a nightmare. I started feeling sick and my relationship with my mom was just as bad as it had always been growing up. When I went home I was still sick and I was supposed to start treatment for PTSD once I got into therapy again. I watched her hurt my dad over and over as a kid. She took me in the shower and told me I smelled bad that I wasn't showering right, and she would touch me and threaten me. She told me to kill myself and to hurt myself so many times. She was on drugs most of my lifetime. I stopped talking to her because she was my trigger and I had no respect left for her. She tried to contact me and taunt me saying she was going to take my tax money again, I called and my aunt picked up, I was very upset and started yelling. I sent my mom a long text message, confronting her about everything she did to me, it wasn't very nice but I was so angry. I told her I hoped she would never die. My family saw the text and told me they'd believe me no matter what, to tell them what my mom did to me, specifically about the sexual abuse. I was already broken down I just told them everything. They didn't believe me and got angry for accusing my mother of such things. My mom sent me a picture of a gun to her head, and I did not respond. I did not want to talk to her anymore. She shot herself shortly after. I don't know what to do. I spent the rest of the day with my friends drinking and getting high and laughing. I cried a lot too but I didn't want to be sad. I don't know if I feel sad or relieved. My entire family is angry with me. I need help
