Anytime I say I'm having a hard time, my friends tell me that they're pulling double and triple shifts while I "sit around." They can't see how I could possibly be hurting when I don't work right now. Some pople have stopped respecting me, even suggesting that my struggles with ptsd as an excuse for laziness.

It seems like either people see me as a disabled loser, or a lazy layabout. People treat me like I'm entitled for not wanting to be pushed to my breaking point at a job. I know I can't possible do what it takes to be employed in this economy right now, and even 40 hours was too much before; it was barely sustainable for me.

Maybe that means I'm weak and disabled, I don't know. It's making me start to doubt myself and feel really insecure, like a parasite on society. I feel like a loser, a failure, and a broken person when people talk to me as if I'm an inferior or weak for being unemployed.

It's rare that anyone comes right out and says it, although it does happen, but mostly the tension is under the surface; I feel it often.

Honestly, it makes me want to fucking give up.
