 can’t calm down or get through anything without expressing myself, verbally or through writing, to an audience. I have tried so many times to just chill out, but my thoughts just go around and around and around. Repeating themselves for hours or days. They will not go away until I get them out of my body by putting them down in the written word or saying them out loud to someone else. I might try journaling, but I’m doubtful that would work since talking to myself out loud doesn’t. I feel trapped like an animal in a cage.
