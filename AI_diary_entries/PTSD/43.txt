 work in the city writing property damage estimates. There were power lines hanging real low to the street, so I was already pretty Hyper-vigilant. While I'm working, a large box truck drove by and knocked down the power lines. I jumped out of the way immediately because the sound of the truck hitting the wires put me into fight or flight instantly. And then the lines fell on top of where I was standing.

A part of me wishes it killed me, but now I've had an epiphany that I do not want to die being so afraid all the time. If that killed me today, I would have never conquered my demons.
