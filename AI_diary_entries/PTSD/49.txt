I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood.

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go.

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

It's a bittersweet truth, but I've made some progress. I used to actively hurt myself because I was so used to others hurting me and telling me I was not good enough. I don't do that anymore
