Usually I am okay I can live my life free of panic attacks. 4th of july gets me anxious but not overly so. However as it gets closer to Oct 1 any loud noise seems to trigger me. Someone honking next to my car can make my entire body shake and if I'm not careful I can slide into a crying panic attack with ease.

I don't know why this is happening it's so frustrating I know I am safe and yet my entire body reacts so fiercely. I feel like I'm losing my mind and I Hate that this has been happening year after year despite making gains and recoveries everywhere else. Even just talking about this is setting me off... I don't know how else to vent.
