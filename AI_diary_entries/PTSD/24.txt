You feel good about yourself, better then you felt in years or you get away from your abusers or you finally feel free of everything then BAM the bullshit starts.

The panic attacks, stress, overthinking, dissociation, depression, feeling worthless, hopeless, to exhausted to do anything, headaches out the ass, body just feels sluggish, can't sleep, can't eat, you just can't fucking function.
