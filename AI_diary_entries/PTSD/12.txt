For nearly half of my life, I've been putting in the work. I've been going to therapy: DBT, CBT, EMDR, IFS, the list goes on. I've been taking medication. I've been inpatient, intensive outpatient. I've done yoga, breathing techniques, grounding activities. I've tried ice cubes and rubber bands to stop self-harming. I've journaled, I've spent time with loved ones, I've read self-help books. I've done all of these things genuinely and hopefully and painfully. And each time I do, everyone assures me that it will work. That if I just keep trying and "put in the effort" I'll be happy in the future. Happiness for me is just the reduction of my most severe symptoms. But I know it's not like that for other people. People don't want to see me at my baseline of wellness. Even when I'm exhausted and proud of everything I've done, I'm not good unless I reach this vision of happiness that I can't even imagine. It feels like there's always been this huge weight on me, this pressure to reach that intangible goal. And anything short of that is a personal failure. I have to relentlessly keep trying, try harder, do more. Their experience with happiness is just not for me, no matter how much I wish it was. I wish people could accept that. I wish I wasn't looked at with the goal of being cured, and instead looked at with the goal of being manageably sick. Some people can only survive and endure, and might never "live" like everyone else. It's not okay, but that's the reality. I wish that was good enough. It's the best i can do.
