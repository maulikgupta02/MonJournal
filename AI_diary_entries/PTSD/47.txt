I heard this on a podcast a few weeks ago. A woman was assaulted and she said that even though she lived, that version of her died that day. Her hopes and dreams for the future, what was important to her. And it really resonated with me.

I’ve felt like this for a while, but since I’ve heard this and started thinking about it more, more memories from around that time in my life have come up. I know I’m still young and I have time to do things in life, but it will never be the same. I’ll never be planning for my future like I was then. I’ll never exist in relationships like I would have then. I’ll never be her again. And I’m not sure if I would’ve become who I am now. And it hurts. I’ve been grieving for my past self a lot lately. It feels like it’s just hitting harder than it used to.
