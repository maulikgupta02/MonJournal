Super triggered by the decision. Don’t care about your politics, the reality is for many of us this incredibly triggering. I’m a multiple rape and sexual violence survivor. The ultimate violation of bodily autonomy. Today woman got told that the courts don’t see they have a right to bodily autonomy. It doesn’t start with rape. It starts with being seeing as not deserving of your own agency. Of not having rights. It’s like all the advancements we’ve made in shedding light on rape culture, violence against women and misogyny were just completed dismantled. And it’s just going to continue. Our consent still doesn’t factor into decisions being made. I am numb. And broken. I can’t move my body. I’m crying on and off. I just see and feel them all. Women are not ok today and survivors are really struggling. Not looking for advice. I just need to vent and be heard.
