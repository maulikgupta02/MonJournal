I feel like recently I have this large gaping wound inside and it just won’t heal. No matter how much I try and read up how to heal it I just can’t. It hurts constantly and I can’t get rid of the pain. No matter if I sleep or am in a supportive environment it stands there. I feel so fragile, vulnerable and anything can kill me off. All this tension and energy remains as I have been holding this wound for so long and it just won’t heal. I have listened to ‘experts’ read books done therapy but it is impossible.This wound is not going to heal. It feels like my boyfriend is in a relationship with someone with terminal cancer that will never get better. That is how I feel about myself. I am never going to get better, all I will ever do is drag him down. Who wants to be in a relationship with someone this damaged emotionally. I am so damaged and unfixable because it is not physical, I can pretend to be fine to strangers as it is so invisible. I am going to graduate to be a doctor, at the end of uni, played high level sports my whole life, a great network of friends and family but it isn’t enough to heal me from the extreme trauma I went through. No one even knows how bad it got because I don’t want to upset people or disturb people with the details, I only want to unload anything to professionals as I was burdened so much and know how heavy and disturbing it can be. I feel so alone just bleeding out slowly. I’m not suicidal. Not anymore but I just think it would be better for him not to be with me because I’m never going to feel okay, my ptsd will never go, my anxiety will never go, that feeling of being unsafe will never go, I never will feel how I did before I was 15. I accept that. Is it kinder to release him from me? I love him so much and just want him to feel happy and not have the burden of my bad mental health.
