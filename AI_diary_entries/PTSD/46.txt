DAE struggle with this?

I went to my gyno today whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic. Since then, I have quit drinking (sober 9 months now), quit smoking cigarettes, been diagnosed with PTSD, started exercising, and struggled through months and months of therapy to try to take care of myself.

Not only did the doc breeze through my paperwork for all of about 6 seconds but instead of seeing the progress I made, it was all about what I still need to do.

Go outside for some exercise! ...hard to do most days when I can’t leave my house.

Try to vape less! ...sure, I’ll work on that in between figuring out if my dad is a rapist or not...

Eat healthier! ...yes, right after I’m done crying alone for an hour, I will go make a healthy meal that doesn’t sound good at all.

SO glad it’s only once a year with her.
