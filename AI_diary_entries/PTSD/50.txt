Even with people I know who have anxiety and depression, it isn't quite the same. I don't think they actually understand. It takes every ounce of willpower I have just to not take the easy way out. My body and mind are constantly exhausted and yet people still expect so much from me. It makes me feel so alone.

I did everything people asked. I stayed alive. I tried to work on my brain. I did the housework. I planned everything. I coordinated everything. I got a full time job. And it's still not enough, and I'm so tired. I wish more people understood.
