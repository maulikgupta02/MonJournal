I've been having a tough time the past few days. Basically I was wondering why I felt weird about a specific date, read through some old journal entries from around that date, found some very intense trauma details I'd forgotten about.

And I'm just feeling like... well... fuck.

Where do you go from there?

I wrote a couple things down and shared them in therapy yesterday, but I'm still feeling pretty awful. It feels like too much to share online or with my partner. Like, too intense, too disturbing, too demanding of other people's energy. So I'm just kind of stewing in it as it dissolves me.

Logically I know I deserve to live. I think I'm a reasonably good person. I mostly like myself.

But recalling memories of being so intensely treated like shit makes me have a hard time envisioning that I could ever be anything other than shit.

I feel like I'm making it up for attention even though I know I'm not.

idk what I need but thanks for listening
