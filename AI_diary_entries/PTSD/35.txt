I'm fucking livid right now. I just did a cursory look through some of my notes before sending them to the VA claims side of things. Somehow, anxiety and depression so bad I have trouble getting out of bed and using video games as a calming coping measure with nightmares that make it impossible to sleep a good measure turned into he's just fucking lazy, barely has anxiety, sometimes he has almost nightmares.



They literally said "almost nightmares." Like holy shit, I literally gave up my guns because of the level of disassociation I have when these things wake me up. What the fuck do I need to say for them to get it?



Oh and the cherry on top, they managed to put "sometimes wishes to die" and "no suicide risk" in the same fucking report. It's like they finally cut out the middle man and just put the claims people in the room with us so they could write the notes the way they want in order to lowball our disability claims.
