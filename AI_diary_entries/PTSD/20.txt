October 2017. The hospital band irritates my wrist. The paper gown folds awkwardly around my stomach. I lied that I was on my period to get the scrubs version of underwear- I don’t remember why I need something to protect me yet. I’ve been here for 49 hours. 50. 51. 52. The lights are blaring. I feel dirty. I haven’t showered. They transferred me after 54 hours. The cinderblock walls are so cold. There’s a little nook in the wall where I curl up and cry. I forgot that I got violent with a nurse. My doctor says that’s called dissociative amnesia. November 2017. The hospital band irritates my wrist. The paper gown folds awkwardly around my stomach. They didn’t give me the underwear this time. American Dad is playing and it makes me comfortable. It’s only been 6 days since my discharge. They transferred me. It’s scary this time. Too much yelling. It’s too loud. I scream once for everyone to shut up and they do. I cry because I scared myself. My cat died. My best friend. December 2017. I hate my residential therapist. She notices my dissociations and how I talk about hating that place. When she asks why, I can’t tell her. I don’t know. She tells me to follow her fingers with my eyes. She tells me to remember. April 2018. It comes back in bits and pieces. I remember at work. I cry behind the clearance section while on my break. July 2018. I wish I didn’t remember. December 2018. I feel it everyday. I feel it all the time. I can’t make friends. They’ll know how dirty I am. March 2019. I’m hitting fat now. When I was 12 I used thin ones and the cuts were superficial. I think I’m hitting fat now. I cut when I feel a flashback coming on. I go through several packs of bandages a month. I don’t know if I can ever stop. February 2020. I had a lot of Everclear tonight. I’m thinking about cutting. I haven’t done it in months. I drank so much I can’t get off the bathroom floor. My roommates find me mid-flashback, insanely drunk like usual. June 2020. The date is next month. I can’t go through another anniversary. I wake up happy one day, a happiness I don’t understand. It doesn’t go away. I am a god. Someone is sending the rain to destroy me. I call strangers maggots. I try to steal power from the trees. The trees are going to kill me. They won’t stop sending me messages. They make it so I can’t eat or sleep. I haven’t eaten or slept in 4 days. I’ve never been more scared. My dad finds me and brings me home. The hospital band irritates my wrist. The paper gown folds awkwardly around my stomach. It’s my first time in an adult unit. I’m prescribed my fourth and fifth medication. January 2021. I think I’m healthy. I’m not binge drinking. I’m not cutting. I have friends. I’m in a relationship. I have between one and three flashbacks, sometimes none. I used to get seven a day. Seven a day. Now, two a week.
