I'm sorry, but after the horror I've had to live through, this gibberish about being a survivor and not a victim is ridiculous. To me there is no distinction. Victimhood is a social construct; survival is luck and instinct. I try to explain my self to "professionals", as someone who has actually LIVED through real violence, and they end up debating with me the semantics of how THEY understand events THEY have never lived through.

Why the fuck am I paying these people $100 an hour to debate with me the verbiage regarding events they don't even bother to try and understand?

Why am I defending the validity of MY pain and MY experiences against the perceptions some asshole with a 2 year certification read in a fucking abnormal psych book - a book I've also read. Books written by out of touch researches at an "ivory tower" research lab, who see the world through the myopic lens of diseases and pathology?

Why am I paying to be told I'm the problem because I don't see things as divided according to some artificial binary between "survivors" and "victims". Man, there are just people - people who've seen shit and suffer.

Maybe the problem is the all pervasive judgment, apathy, and disdain I get from people for struggling with PTSD, but then again I'm not a fucking professional, so what would I know? Fuck it.
