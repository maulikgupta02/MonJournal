I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves.

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried.

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, "Rape made me better" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.
