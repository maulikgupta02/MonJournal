was kidnapped at the age of 22 by a psychotic maniac on the run from the law and held against my will for 11 months It was hell. Everyday was hell. Of course I now have complex PTSD. I'm 64 now and am still traumatized. My whole life was ruined by the time I was 23. I never got married, never had kids. I've been a loner ever since. I still get intrusive memories of horrific child abuse. I don't know why I'm even posting this. But I know people here understand.
