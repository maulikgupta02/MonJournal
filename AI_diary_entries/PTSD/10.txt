Saturday was a rough day well, really Friday night. I had night terrors all night that kept me up and by Saturday morning I just wanted to sleep so bad that I broke down crying on the couch in front of my wife. days like that are contrasted with days like today, it’s so beautiful out today a bit chilly but that is truly my biggest complaint. I got to see friends today and I feel good. I hate that now two days can have such different feelings. I go to sleep not knowing what the night is going to hold for me and that is hard…to anyone else who experiences night terrors just know that you’re not alone it’s OK to ask for help.
