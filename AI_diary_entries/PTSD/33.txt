When I tell people about my trauma and talk about stuff, I feel like people always say some iteration of “oh you’re so strong”. I know there is absolutely no poor intention behind this. I actually feel kind of guilty for not liking it, but it just feels so … performative? Generic? I’m not even sure why it bothers me. I didn’t choose to have these things happen. Being abused and traumatized doesn’t make me strong. It just makes me traumatized. I was dealt a shitty hand and I’m figuring out how to survive with the weight of that, I’m not thriving under it.
