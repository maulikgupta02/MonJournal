I lost most of my friends and I just have no will to make friends and socialize. I don’t think I can relate to anyone anymore or will they ever understand me. Everything people talk about seem so pointless and first world problem-y. I just can’t socialize or have the patience to, I just prefer being alone. People annoy me a lot. But I picture my ideal life with few good friends and a meaningful partner. So it’s like a bit of a paradox.
