i get it’s public information and people are more curious about the taboo.. i don’t mean to react out of emotion and pain. it just hurt so much, they didn’t ask for permission, NO notification.. just made a multiple part podcast … years later.. and it gained enough traction to be sent to my parents and I.. and it really triggered me more than I thought it would and felt blindsiding and as a younger person- I understood that these podcasts ( even if my sensitivity doesn’t understand the enjoyment) are a thing and there is a huge market.. but I had to explain to my older parents first- what a podcast is, but also how they could be allowed to do this? It just hurts so bad. They don’t know rlly how to use their phones , so luckily they can’t play it / fully navigate the site , so I am the one emailing and there was crime scene photos on the website without warning. And then, I’m an idiot so I listened. It started with an upbeat plug for their merch :D, light banter and even a moment where they described elements of his death “fascinating”…

And it’s such a heavy topic, so I don’t know how to talk about it. I have work tomorrow and I just idk it all feels like so much

If you read this much, thank you also- is there a support group for that kind of situation ?

Edit; thank you all so so much for the acceptance, resources and just respect. it means so much.. i do not intend on taking legal action or anything - just rather contact to see if they tried to reach out to us - and then maybe ask them to at least take the crime photos off the website - because it’s one thing for me to have clicked the podcast.. that was my choice.. but the photos on the site is excessive.
