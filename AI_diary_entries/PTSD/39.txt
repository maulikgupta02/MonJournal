Roughly two years ago, I was homeless. I’m housed now thanks to subsidized housing but still struggling greatly.

Ptsd puts our mind and body into survival mode, but that’s extended so much when basic things like food aren’t a guarantee.

I’ve talked about it with my therapist. Went over the hierarchy of needs and how often when our most basic needs aren’t met, we struggle to do anything.

Doing tasks that aren’t basic needs for survival become more difficult. It makes sense really. Our survival instinct is we need food to survive. Why would we care about anything else?

It’s stressful. It’s draining. I sit and worry about if we will have food in the fridge in the next few days. I worry if I’ll lose the roof over my head again one day. All I do is worry about it.

It’s also draining because often the body isn’t getting what it needs to function. If you rely on the food bank to feed yourself your meals aren’t what you need them to be. Things like milk, eggs, meat, fresh veggies and fruits often aren’t available. You don’t get enough to make GENUINE home cooked meals. (Ofc this varies by location, but the one near me is often lacking)

I’ve been lower class my whole life, but am at the “lowest” I’ve been rn. And it sucks.
