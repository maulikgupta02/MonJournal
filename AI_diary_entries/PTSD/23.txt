What is with this unhealthy obsession people have with forgiveness? Why do I have to forgive every wrong done to me? Why is it that if I can't forgive I can't move past it (to them)? Why do they think that because I 'can't forgive' that I'm always thinking about it, brooding resentment?

Why can't they just accept that I've been hurt? I will never forget what happened, and it doesn't mean I am dwelling on it and creating resentment in my heart. My intrusive thoughts are not proof that it is constantly on my mind and that it's a sign that I need to just forgive and forget and move on to heal.

This weird obsession with healing in not healthy! Sometimes there is no healing, there is only managing whats left. Sometimes there is never resolution. Sometimes, the person whose been hurt decides the pain is not worth it. Why is that not acceptable? Why is it being a coward?

And fuck you for telling me I need more patience. I've been TOO patient my entire life. I dont have the capacity for patience anymore. I am in constant pain, physical and mental. Why can't I be allowed to say ENOUGH!? Why am I not allowed to have a break? I need a vacation from this pain but there is no leaving it behind.
