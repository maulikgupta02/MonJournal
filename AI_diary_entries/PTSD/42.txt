After my trauma I shut everyone out of my life for months. I didn’t care to see or talk to anyone.

Even now years later I don’t let anyone really know me - even my SO doesn’t know everything that I went through or the person that I used to be. I talk to him about my past hobbies and such, but when I try to share some of them I just freeze and can’t. Part of that is because my trauma was because I let someone evil get close to me, and I know I could work through it nowadays but I don’t really care to tbh.

I have one friend, a coworker. We don’t really hang out outside of work, but they’re the closest I’ve had to a genuine friendship since everything happened to me. I don’t trust hardly anyone anymore, even now.
