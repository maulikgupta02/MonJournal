6:05 a.m.
Wake up, start freelance work with my cat curled up on the desk.

8:50 a.m.
I’m at my job and writing two articles peacefully, the absorption leaving me anxiety-free for the moment.

12 p.m.
I decide I should cancel the meditation class I signed up for tonight so I have more time to work. I’m really anxious, again. I take some Xanax to slow down because I am feeling out of control.

4 p.m.
The Xanax makes me sleepy, so I sleep for 30 minutes during a late lunch.
