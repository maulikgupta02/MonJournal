I have been crying and shaking for hours and days and yet people believe i could be lying about what happened

Sometimes i wish i had more visible bruises so they’d believe me but I doubt even then they’d listen

All I’ve been told with little to no comfort is to just “get over it already” i cant believe someone saying “You didnt deserve what happened to you” would be too much....
