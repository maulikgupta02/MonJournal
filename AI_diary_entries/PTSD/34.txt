Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor, I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was done to me by another person. My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such.

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.
