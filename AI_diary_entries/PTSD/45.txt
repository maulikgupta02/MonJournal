So many people have just treated me like absolute dogshit for my symptoms. Then they’ll go online and virtue signal about supporting mental health and how the system has to be better, all while treating the actual mentally ill in their life like shit. As I’ve gotten sicker, it feels like everyone has abandoned me. The second I start showing symptoms I’m suddenly too sick to be friends with.

I’ve literally had an 8yr friend kick me out for going into a flashback after he triggered me into it, immediately after I told him I couldn’t talk about the thing he wanted to talk about because it would send me into a flashback. He told me waiting was inconvenient for him. Like his inconvenience mattered more than me not going through the living hell of reliving trauma. And then after I went into a flashback, instead of checking on me or asking if I was okay, he told me I’m too sick and I’ll ruin his happy memories.

I just don’t understand why people are so cruel when you’re already down.
