 jump at most everything. Even the smallest of movements will make me gasp and I’ll get startled. People always laugh whenever this happens and it always really hurts me because of why I do it. The way ptsd has manifested for me, and a lot of people who struggle with ptsd, means being on edge all the time. My body is constantly looking for danger even if I’m not aware. I can’t control my hyper-vigilance and don’t think it’s very funny or fair others get a kick out of it. It’s one of my biggest pet peeves and turn off for friendships. I know it can be funny but it’s just a reminder of how hurt my body is and will be. It’s truly just very depressing. Anyone relate?
