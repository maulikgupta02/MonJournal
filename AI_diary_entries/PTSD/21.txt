If you're in the older crowds you might now see this as much but I hate how these words became little trendy quirks to have or use as memes on social media. I've also kind of just resented how they've become part of mainstream vernacular and not in a good way you know?

For example I saw someone describe an incident where their friend read their journal too their crush in 7th grade as "traumatizing" like...genuinely they believe they have trauma from this. It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's "Don't compare your trauma to others," and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.

I also hate how terms like "disassociate" or "intrusive thoughts" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated. It's not fun. It just makes me feel stupid. I'm sick of my mental illness and trauma being the trendy personality trait of the year.
