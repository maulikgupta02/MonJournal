I was on a date today with a girl I’ve been seeing for a while, and I finally opened up to her about my PTSD, and she said she didn’t knew I served in the military. I didn’t. I told her that. She immediately became more cold and even called me a pussy and sick because I’m ridiculing others that actually have PTSD and have been traumatized by blaming all my petty problems to fake PTSD. She emasculates me for saying that I have PTSD when I don’t, because evidently I’m not strong or “man” enough to deal with problems normally. Sorry my parents fucking beat me for the first 18 years of my life. Now she’s left me and I’m just typing this out of anger and frustration because I’m sitting here not able to sleep because I know I’ll get more night terrors if I do let myself sleep and I just can’t handle them anymore. I hate this.

Thanks for reading whoever did, just wanted to vent y’all.

Edit: Didn’t expect to get this many upvotes, I was just venting y’all lol. Thanks for all the kind words, the encouragement to move on and realize that I dodged a bullet, and the hope that I’ll find someone who’ll have the proper compassion to accept me how I should.
