But recently on the 20th of December 2022 my brother was killed at 43 while dirt bike riding (wasn't his fault or been stupid). I knew I was grieving and did the whole saying goodbye, funeral and wake. I still coped okay.

But recently in the last couple weeks I can't really sleep. I live in a rougher neighbourhood and there are always motorbikes hooning past at odd hours of the night. It annoyed me but meh. Now when I'm asleep I wake up and I'm shaking, in tears, gasping for air. I immediately feel dread, and I just replay what happened to my brother over and over. It's like a movie I can't turn of. It feels so flipping real, I try and go back to sleep so I don't wake my 4-year-old, but I just see my brother staring at me.

I'm finally thinking of getting medicated even just till I sort myself out. But I'm so flipping reluctant to I don't want to be a zombie. It's that fine line I tip toe.
