So sick of medical professionals having no clue about mental health issues and worse, being dismissive, skeptical and condecending when you mention it. Actual mental health doctor have been great but other medical personnel need serious education in how to interact with those suffering with any mental health issue. This should be a major part of the foundation education of doctors etc... And not just a specialty!

It is hard enough getting the strength and courage to ask for help without facing so many obstacles when you are struggling so hard to manage even the smallest day to day things.

I want to tell everyone here that I hear you, I believe you, and keep fighting until to get the help you need. Screw the people who dont understand.
